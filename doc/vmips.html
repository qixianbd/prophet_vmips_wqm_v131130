<h2 class="chapter">1 Overview</h2>

<p><a name="index-simulator-1"></a><a name="index-virtual-machine-2"></a><a name="index-MIPS-3"></a><a name="index-MIPS-R3000-4"></a>VMIPS is a simulator for a machine compatible with the MIPS R3000 RISC
architecture. VMIPS consists entirely of software; no special hardware is
required to run programs on VMIPS&mdash;that is, VMIPS is a virtual machine.

   <p><a name="index-RISC-5"></a><a name="index-RISC-architecture-6"></a><a name="index-architecture-7"></a>Since VMIPS is based on an already-existing architecture, it is relatively
easy to find tools to build programs that will run on VMIPS. Since VMIPS is
based on a RISC architecture, its primitive machine-language commands are
all fairly simple to understand and implement.

   <p>VMIPS is easily extended by programmers to include more virtual devices,
such as frame buffers, disk drives, etc. VMIPS is written in C++ and uses
a fairly simple class structure. Furthermore, VMIPS is intended to be a
&ldquo;concrete&rdquo; virtual machine which its users can modify at will&mdash;&ldquo;concrete&rdquo;
meaning that it maintains a tight correspondence between its structures
and structures which actually appear in modern physical computer hardware. 
For example, a programmer who wished to modify the CPU simulation could
easily extract the <code>CPU</code> class from the VMIPS source code, and replace
it with one which was more to his/her liking.

   <p><a name="index-debugger-8"></a><a name="index-gdb-9"></a>VMIPS is also designed with debugging and testing in mind, offering an
interface to the GNU debugger GDB by which programs can be debugged while
they run on the simulator. As such, it is intended to be a practical
simulator target for compilers and assembly language/hardware-software
interface courses.

   <p><a name="index-free-software-10"></a>VMIPS is free software. This means that you are free to share VMIPS
with everyone, and we encourage you to do so, but we do not give you
the freedom to restrict others from sharing it with everyone. For a
comprehensive explanation please read the GNU General Public License.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Getting Started</h2>

<p>Step 0. If VMIPS is installed on your system, you can start building
programs with it right away.  Otherwise, you (or your system
administrator) will have to compile VMIPS first; see the appendix on
Installation.

   <p><a name="index-vmipstool-usage-11"></a><a name="index-vmipstool-12"></a><a name="index-vmips-13"></a>Step 1. First, compile your program. You should have a MIPS cross-compiler
available.  VMIPS supports the GNU C Compiler; most installations of
VMIPS will also have an installation of the GNU C Compiler targetting
the MIPS architecture.  Your easiest interface to the C compiler will
probably be through the `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool</span></samp>' program; to run the MIPS compiler
that VMIPS was installed with, use the `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool --compile</span></samp>' command.

   <p><a name="index-linking_002c-using-vmipstool-14"></a>Step 2. Link your program with any support code necessary. VMIPS comes
with some canned support code, in the share/setup directory, or you
can write your own support code. VMIPS comes with a linker script for
simple standalone programs, which you can run with `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool --link</span></samp>',
or you can write your own linker script.

   <p><a name="index-ROM_002c-building-with-vmipstool-15"></a>Step 3. Build a ROM image. This is necessary because the current version of
VMIPS does not read in executables. Most real machines don't; they have
an embedded program on a piece of flash ROM that reads in the first
executable and runs it. This makes development a little more realistic, but
not quite so convenient; this may change in the future, but for now it's
necessary. To build a ROM image, use the script that comes with VMIPS, by
running `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool --make-rom</span></samp>'.

   <p>Step 4. Start the simulator using `<samp><span class="samp">vmips ROMFILE</span></samp>', where `<samp><span class="samp">ROMFILE</span></samp>' is
the name of your ROM image.  Your program should run to completion,
and if you are using the canned setup code that comes with VMIPS,
the simulator should halt when it hits the first <code>break</code> instruction, which
should happen right after your <code>entry</code> function returns.

<h2 class="chapter">3 An Example</h2>

<p><a name="index-vmipstool-16"></a><a name="index-vmips-17"></a>Let's assume you have VMIPS already compiled, and that you have some
setup code in <samp><span class="file">setup.s</span></samp>, and a standalone program (i.e., not one
meant to run under an operating system) in <samp><span class="file">hello.c</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-assembling_002c-using-vmipstool-18"></a>First assemble the setup code.
<pre class="example">     vmipstool --assemble -o setup.o setup.s
</pre>
   <p>Note: if you get an `installation error' from vmipstool, you may need to edit
your <samp><span class="file">/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp> the first time you use vmipstool.  See the
`Post-Installation Setup' section of the `Installation' appendix for more
information.

   <p><a name="index-compiling_002c-using-vmipstool-19"></a>Compile your program:
<pre class="example">     vmipstool --compile -c hello.c
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-linking_002c-using-vmipstool-20"></a>Then, link your program and the setup code together to produce an executable:
<pre class="example">     vmipstool --link -o hello setup.o hello.o
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-ROM_002c-building-with-vmipstool-21"></a>Build a ROM image from the executable:
<pre class="example">     vmipstool --make-rom hello hello.rom
</pre>
   <p>Run the program.
<pre class="example">     vmips hello.rom
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-halting-simulation-22"></a>The program will terminate, by default, when your setup code generates
a breakpoint exception (using the <code>break</code> instruction, for
example). This termination condition can be changed by adding one of the
<samp><span class="option">halt</span></samp> options to the file <samp><span class="file">.vmipsrc</span></samp> in your home directory.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Building Programs</h2>

<h3 class="section">4.1 Source Languages</h3>

<p><a name="index-C-language-23"></a>Programs for VMIPS are generally built out of C or assembly-language source
code. It is theoretically possible to use C++ or other languages, but the
infrastructure required has not yet been investigated or documented.

<h3 class="section">4.2 ROM Programs</h3>

<p><a name="index-ROM_002c-programs-in-24"></a>The easiest way to get VMIPS to run a program is to install that program as
the VMIPS ROM. Building a C program as a ROM requires that you link it with
some setup code.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Default Setup Code</h3>

<p><a name="index-setup-code-25"></a><a name="index-startup-code-26"></a><a name="index-initialization-code-27"></a>This section describes the default VMIPS setup code.  It also describes
the minimal set of things you need to do before you can run C code
from the ROM, since that is the intended purpose of the default VMIPS
setup code.

   <p>Start by clearing out registers and TLB entries.

   <p><a name="index-stack-pointer_002c-initializing-28"></a>Set yourself up a stack pointer ($sp). Usually this can just be some
number of megabytes above the end of your code's data segment.  You can
get the address of the end of your code's data segment from your linker
script.

   <p><a name="index-globals-pointer_002c-initializing-29"></a>Set up your globals pointer ($gp), if your code uses global data. 
You can get the right address from your linker script.

   <p><a name="index-ROM_002c-data-in-30"></a>If you have writable data in ROM, your C code probably doesn't realize
that it's in ROM, and it will want to write to it. You should copy the
writable data to RAM. There is code to do this in the canned setup code
provided with VMIPS.

   <p>Note: The canned setup code is hard-wired for 1 MByte of memory. It
operates with a very simple memory map: writable data and bss
(uninitialized data) above <code>DATA_START</code>, and the stack grows down
from <code>DATA_START</code>.  The linker script and the canned setup code
share some hard-wired constants related to this memory map; you should be
careful to coordinate your changes if you wish to change the memory map.

   <p><a name="index-main-31"></a><a name="index-entry-32"></a>Finally, your setup code should finish by calling the entry point of your
C code. Usually this will have a name like <code>entry</code>; using the name
<code>main</code> is not recommended, because many versions of GCC assume that
they can call standard C runtime setup functions (such as are normally
found in <samp><span class="file">crt0.o</span></samp>) from the beginning of <code>main</code>. You may or
may not want this.

   <p><a name="index-break-instruction_002c-to-halt-machine-33"></a>When the C code returns, you will probably want to halt the machine;
the default way to do this is by executing a break instruction. Read the
following section for details.

<h3 class="section">4.4 Exceptions</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Handling exceptions</h4>

<p><a name="index-exceptions_002c-handling-34"></a>Your startup code should have some kind of exception support.  If you
don't, exceptions are likely to make your program loop forever, because
the jump to the exception vector will result in the execution of garbage
or in a unmapped access, either of which are likely to cause exceptions.

   <p><a name="index-exceptions_002c-minimal-handler-for-35"></a><a name="index-break-instruction_002c-to-halt-machine-36"></a>An absolutely minimal exception handler is a break instruction at address
0xbfc00180, which will halt the machine on any exception, providing
you have the <samp><span class="option">haltbreak</span></samp> option set. This is also a handy way to halt
the machine after your program ends, if you are writing kernel code;
just follow the jump to your kernel code by a <code>break</code> instruction.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Exception vectors</h4>

<p><a name="index-exceptions_002c-vectors-for-37"></a><a name="index-exceptions_002c-addresses-for-38"></a>If the Boot-time Exception Vectors are in use, exceptions use the
base address 0xbfc00100 (which is in unmapped, uncached kernel space),
otherwise they use the base address 0x80000000 (which is in unmapped,
cached kernel space).  You can control this by setting or clearing the
Boot-time Exception Vector bit (bit 22, or 0x00400000) in the Status
register (register 12 of coprocessor zero). If the bit is set, the
Boot-time Exception Vectors will be used.

   <p><a name="index-exceptions_002c-user_002dspace-TLB-miss-39"></a>User-space TLB Miss exceptions have a special vector, which is obtained by
adding 0 to the base address. All other exceptions use the general vector,
which is obtained by adding 0x080 to the base address. This obviously
places a bit of a restriction on the layout of the beginning of your ROM code:
the setup code must either fit in the first 0x100 bytes, or it must be structured
so that it jumps past the exception vectors.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 Exception codes and their meanings</h4>

<p><a name="index-exceptions_002c-codes-for-40"></a>Whenever control is transferred to your exception handler, the ExcCode
field of the Cause register, that is, bits 6 - 2 (0x007c) of register 13
of coprocessor 0, are filled in with one of the following exception codes. 
Each exception code has a canonical short name, included in parentheses next
to the exception code number, and is followed by a short description of the
circumstances where it occurs.

     <dl>
<dt><code>0 (Int)</code><dd>Hardware or software interrupt. Some device or process is trying to get
the processor's attention.

     <br><dt><code>1 (Mod)</code><dd>TLB modification exception. The memory address translation mapped to a TLB
entry, but that entry's &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; bit was set.

     <br><dt><code>2 (TLBL)</code><dd>TLB exception caused by a data load (i.e., a load word or similar
instruction) or instruction fetch. The memory address translation did
not match any valid TLB entry.

     <br><dt><code>3 (TLBS)</code><dd>TLB exception caused by a data store (i.e., a store word or similar
instruction). The memory address translation did not match any valid TLB
entry.

     <br><dt><code>4 (AdEL)</code><dd>Address error exception caused by a data load or instruction fetch. The
PC was not word-aligned, or the address the load instruction wanted to
load from was not aligned to the width of the load instruction. (For
example, load halfword instructions must be 2-byte aligned.)

     <br><dt><code>5 (AdES)</code><dd>Address error exception caused by a data store. The address the store
instruction wanted to store to was not aligned to the width of the store
instruction. (For example, store halfword instructions must be 2-byte
aligned.)

     <br><dt><code>6 (IBE)</code><dd>Bus error caused by an instruction fetch. The PC does not correspond to
any real area of memory.

     <br><dt><code>7 (DBE)</code><dd>Bus error caused by a data load or store. The target address of the load
or store instruction does not correspond to any real area of memory.

     <br><dt><code>8 (Sys)</code><dd>SYSCALL exception. Some code was trying to call the operating system,
using a SYSCALL instruction.  This exception is the processor's way of
transferring control to the operating system.

     <br><dt><code>9 (Bp)</code><dd>Breakpoint exception. Some process executed a BREAK instruction. This is the
processor's way of allowing the operating system to stop the process and do
whatever is appropriate (alert the user using the debugger, for example).

     <br><dt><code>10 (RI)</code><dd>Reserved instruction exception. Some code executed something which wasn't
a valid MIPS-1 instruction.

     <br><dt><code>11 (CpU)</code><dd>Coprocessor Unusable. Some code executed an instruction which tried to
reference a coprocessor that isn't configured in VMIPS.

     <br><dt><code>12 (Ov)</code><dd>Arithmetic Overflow.  Some code executed an instruction whose arithmetic
answer was too big to fit in a register using two's-complement arithmetic. The
processor issues this exception so that the operating system can stop or
otherwise signal the process.

     <br><dt><code>13 (Tr)</code><dd>Trap. This exception is only issued on the R4000 or R6000 processor and
compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>14 (NCD)</code><dd>LDCz or SDCz (coprocessor load/store) using an address which wasn't in
the cache. This exception is only issued on the R6000 processor and compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>14 (VCEI)</code><dd>Virtual Coherency Exception (instruction). This exception is only issued on
the R4000 processor and compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>15 (MV)</code><dd>Machine check exception. This exception is only issued on
the R6000 processor and compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>15 (FPE)</code><dd>Floating-point exception. This exception is only issued on
the R4000 processor and compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>16-22</code><dd>Reserved, not used.

     <br><dt><code>23 (WATCH)</code><dd>Reference to WatchHi/WatchLo address detected. This exception is only issued
on the R4000 processor and compatibles.

     <br><dt><code>24-30</code><dd>Reserved, not used.

     <br><dt><code>31 (VCED)</code><dd>Virtual Coherency Exception (data). This exception is only issued on
the R4000 processor and compatibles. 
</dl>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.4 Exception prioritizing</h4>

<p>It is possible for more than one exception to occur during the emulation
of the same instruction.  The MIPS architecture has a system for
determining which of a set of conflicting exceptions is reported to
the exception handler.

   <p>When two or more exceptions occur on the same execution of the same
instruction, only one is reported, according to the priority
list, below. The ordering is by exception code (EXCCODE) and mode of memory
access (MODE), where applicable. Each ordered pair (EXCCODE, MODE)
below has the priority listed in brackets. * denotes a position where
any value matches.

   <p>This prioritization is implemented in the <code>exception_priority()</code>
member function of class CPU.

     <dl>
<dt><code>[1]</code><dd>Address error - instruction fetch
(AdEL, INSTFETCH)

     <br><dt><code>[2]</code><dd>TLB refill - instruction fetch
TLB invalid - instruction fetch
(TLBL, INSTFETCH)
(TLBS, INSTFETCH)

     <br><dt><code>[3]</code><dd>Bus error - instruction fetch
(IBE, *)

     <br><dt><code>[4]</code><dd>Integer overflow, Trap, System call, Breakpoint, Reserved
Instruction, or Coprocessor Unusable
(Ov, *)
(Tr, *)
(Sys, *)
(Bp, *)
(RI, *)
(CpU, *)

     <br><dt><code>[5]</code><dd>Address error - data load or data store
(AdEL, DATALOAD)
(AdES, *)

     <br><dt><code>[6]</code><dd>TLB refill - data load or data store
TLB invalid - data load or data store
(TLBL, DATALOAD)
(TLBS, DATALOAD)
(TLBL, DATASTORE)
(TLBS, DATASTORE)

     <br><dt><code>[7]</code><dd>TLB modified - data store
(Mod, *)

     <br><dt><code>[8]</code><dd>Bus error - data load or data store
(DBE, *)

     <br><dt><code>[9]</code><dd>Interrupt
(Int, *)
</dl>

<h3 class="section">4.5 Linking</h3>

<p>You want the text section of your program to start with the setup
code, so link in the setup code first &mdash; that is, put the name of the
object file containing the setup code first on the linker command line.

   <p>You want the setup code to start at 0xbfc00000, which is the MIPS
reset exception vector. In practical terms, when VMIPS starts up,
it will reset. When VMIPS resets, it jumps to 0xbfc00000, which is
the beginning of your setup code.

<h3 class="section">4.6 Common Errors in Compilation</h3>

<p>If the linker complains about not being able to find the
symbol <code>_gp_disp</code>, you should turn on the GCC option
<samp><span class="option">-mno-abicalls</span></samp>. <code>_gp_disp</code> is used by the SGI N32 ABI for
MIPS ELF.  One reliable reference source claims, &ldquo;<code>_gp_disp</code> is
a reserved symbol defined by the linker to be the distance between the
lui instruction and the context pointer.&rdquo; The GNU linkers currently in
use do not appear to support this function.

   <p>If you get lots of <code>R_MIPS_GPREL16</code> relocation failures from
the linker, there are two workarounds: either combine all the files
together first with `<samp><span class="samp">ld -x -r -o bigfile.o </span><var>&lt;all your files&gt;</var></samp>'
and then use `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool --link</span></samp>' on <samp><span class="file">bigfile.o</span></samp>, or compile
with <samp><span class="option">-G 0</span></samp> in your <code>CFLAGS</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.1 Dealing with kernel code in GCC</h4>

<p>If you have a <code>main()</code> function in your code, GCC expects it to
return an int.  If you don't like this, use <samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp>
or <samp><span class="option">-Wno-main</span></samp>. You have to have GCC 2.95.2 or later for this to
work, though; it won't work in EGCS 1.1.1.

   <p>If you have a <code>main()</code> function in your code, GCC will try to
call <code>__main</code> or some other kind of setup function even if you
use <samp><span class="option">-ffreestanding</span></samp>.  There is probably a way to configure the cross
compiler so that it won't try to do this;  it will be documented here
once it is discovered.  A simple workaround is to call the entry function
<code>entry</code> instead of <code>main</code>. You can also try defining
<code>void __main(void)</code> to be an empty function.

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.2 MIPS position-independent code</h4>

<p>In Linux/MIPS, PIC (position-independent code) is the default. 
An important implication is that GCC configured for <code>mips-linux</code>
or <code>mipsel-linux</code> will, by default, use the <code>$gp</code> register
to access global variables. This is fine in most user programs,
but you may find that it causes you trouble if you are writing a ROM
for use in VMIPS because the <code>$gp</code> register may not contain a
valid pointer. The easiest thing to do is turn off this behavior by
giving gcc the <samp><span class="option">-fno-pic</span></samp> option, which also turns on the gas
<samp><span class="option">-non_shared</span></samp> option.  If you compile with vmipstool, it will
turn on these flags for you by default.

   <p>In many MIPS operating systems, register <code>$t9</code> is reserved for the
ABI as a globals pointer when compiling position-independent code, and
the assembly writer (programmer or compiler) must issue <code>.cpsave</code>
and <code>.cprestore</code> assembler directives upon function entry and exit
to put the right globals pointer values into this register. Similarly
to the <samp><span class="option">-fno-pic</span></samp> option above, it is easy to turn this off while
writing ROM code by using the gcc <samp><span class="option">-mno-abicalls</span></samp> option. If you
compile with vmipstool, it will turn this flag on for you by default.

<h4 class="subsection">4.6.3 Building ROMs</h4>

<p>If it takes a long time to build a ROM or the ROM file fills the disk,
make sure all the sections your linker is producing are accounted for
in the linker script. Do an `<samp><span class="samp">objdump -x</span></samp>' on the executable which
you are using to build the ROM image, and make sure that the difference
between any two of the LMAs (load memory addresses) of the sections
in the file is not a lot bigger than the total size of the executable. 
This metric is strictly a rule of thumb, but it easily identifies when
a section has not been put into the linker script: if a load memory
address for some section is expecting to be in RAM (0xa0000000, for
example), and the load memory address for all the other sections is in
ROM (around 0xbfc00000), then you will lose because writing out a memory
image to be used as a ROM file would take roughly 0xbfc00000 - 0xa0000000
= 532676608 bytes (about 500 megs). The solution is to make sure that
all LMAs in the executable are sane with respect to the `<samp><span class="samp">loadaddr</span></samp>'
variable in your <samp><span class="file">.vmipsrc</span></samp>, usually by adding any new sections
you find to either the .text, .data, or .bss section of the linker script.

<h2 class="chapter">5 Invoking vmips</h2>

<p>VMIPS is started by running the "vmips" program from the command line. 
The format of the VMIPS command line is any one of the following:

<!-- man begin SYNOPSIS -->
<pre class="example">     vmips [-n] [-F FILE] [-o option_string] ... rom_file
     vmips --help
     vmips --version
     vmips --print-config
</pre>
   <!-- man end -->
<!-- man begin OPTIONS -->
<p>This is what the different command line options mean:

     <dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-F FILE</span></samp>'<dd>Read options from FILE instead of the <samp><span class="file">.vmipsrc</span></samp> in your home directory.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>'<dd>Do not read the system-wide configuration file, usually called
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--help</span></samp>'<dd>Prints a short summary of VMIPS command line options, and exits
successfully.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--version</span></samp>'<dd>Prints a short summary of VMIPS version and copyright information,
and exits successfully.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--print-config</span></samp>'<dd>Prints a short summary of VMIPS compile-time configuration information,
and exits successfully.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-o something</span></samp>'<dd>Set the option "something" as if "something" were in your
.vmipsrc file.  See the "VMIPS options" section of the
"Customizing" chapter for more information on what kind
of things can go in your .vmipsrc file. You can use as many
-o options on the command line as your shell will let you.

     <p><a name="index-ROM_002c-selecting-file-for-41"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">rom_file</span></samp>'<dd>Use the named file as the ROM file VMIPS should boot. This

<h2 class="chapter">6 Customizing</h2>

<h3 class="section">6.1 VMIPS options</h3>

<p>The VMIPS simulator gets runtime options from four different sources,
in this order: first, it checks its compile-time defaults, which are
set by the site administrator in the source file <samp><span class="file">optiontbl.h</span></samp>. Then,
the system-wide configuration file is read, unless you specify the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>'
option; usually this file is called
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp>, but it may have been moved by the site
administrator or by the maintainers of your distribution. 
(This is configurable in the source file <samp><span class="file">options.h</span></samp>, and
by specifying the &ndash;prefix and &ndash;sysconfdir options to the GNU
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
script when building VMIPS.) Next, it checks the user's own configuration
file, usually the file <samp><span class="file">.vmipsrc</span></samp> in your home directory, or whatever
file you specify using the `<samp><span class="samp">-F</span></samp>' option. Last, it
reads the command line, and gets any options listed there.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Format of the configuration file</h3>

<p>The configuration file may contain as many options per line as you want,
provided no single line exceeds 1,024 characters in length.  Whitespace
separates options from one another.  Single quotes and backslash are valid
in the configuration file. Their meanings are similar to those found in
the Bourne shell: any text within paired single quotes is uninterpreted,
as is any character immediately following a backslash.  A comment is
any text starting from a hash mark to the end of the line, inclusive.

   <p>A string or number option named NAME can appear as NAME=VALUE, where VALUE
is the string or number in question.  If the number begins with 0x, it will
be interpreted as a 32-bit hexadecimal number, and if it begins with 0,
it will be interpreted as octal. Otherwise, it will be interpreted as a
decimal number. Numbers are always unsigned. A Boolean option named NAME
can appear as either NAME (to set it to TRUE) or noNAME (to set it to FALSE).

<h3 class="section">6.3 Summary of configuration options</h3>

<p>The following is a list of the configuration options present in this
version of VMIPS.

<!-- This part of the manual is automatically generated by `makeoptdoc'. -->
<p><samp><span class="option">haltdumpcpu</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether the CPU registers and stack will be dumped
on halt. For the output format, please see the description of the
<samp><span class="option">dumpcpu</span></samp> option, below.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">haltdumpcp0</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0) registers
and the contents of the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) will be
dumped on halt. For the output format, please see the description
of the <samp><span class="option">dumpcp0</span></samp> option, below.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">excpriomsg</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether exception prioritizing messages will
be printed.  These messages attempt to explain which of
a number of exceptions caused by the same instruction
will be reported.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">excmsg</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether every exception will cause a message
to be printed. The message gives the exception code, a
short explanation of the exception code, its priority,
the delay slot state of the virtual CPU, and states
what type of memory access the exception was caused by,
if applicable. Interrupt exceptions are only printed if
<samp><span class="option">reportirq</span></samp> is also set; when they occur, they also have Cause
and Status register information printed.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">bootmsg</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether boot-time and halt-time messages will be printed. 
These include ROM image size, self test messages, reset and halt
announcements, and possibly other messages.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">instdump</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether every instruction executed will be disassembled
and printed.  The default value is FALSE. The output is in the following format:
<pre class="example">     PC=0xbfc00000 [1fc00000]    24000000 li $zero,0
</pre>
   <p>The first column contains the PC (program counter), followed by
the physical translation of that address in brackets. The third
column contains the machine instruction word at that address,
followed by the assembly language corresponding to that word. 
All of the constants except for the assembly language are in
hexadecimal.

   <p><samp><span class="option">dumpcpu</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether the CPU registers and stack will be dumped after every
instruction.  The default value is FALSE. The output is in the following format:
<pre class="example">     Reg Dump: [ PC=bfc00180  LastInstr=0000000d  HI=00000000  LO=00000000
                 DelayState=NORMAL  DelayPC=bfc00308  NextEPC=bfc00308
      R00=00000000  R01=00000000  R02=00000000  R03=a00c000e  R04=0000000a
      ...
      R30=00000000  R31=bfc00308  ]
     Stack: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 a2000008 a2000008 ...
</pre>
   <p>(Some values have been omitted for brevity.) 
Here, PC is the program counter, LastInstr is the last instruction
executed, HI and LO are the multiplication/division result registers,
DelayState and DelayPC are used in delay slot processing, NextEPC
is what the Exception PC would be if an exception were to occur, and
R00 ... R31 are the CPU general purpose registers. Stack represents
the top few words on the stack.  All values are in hexadecimal.

   <p><samp><span class="option">dumpcp0</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Controls whether the system control coprocessor (CP0)
registers and the contents of the translation lookaside buffer
(TLB) will be dumped after every instruction.   The default value is FALSE. 
The output is in the following format:
<pre class="example">     CP0 Dump Registers: [        R00=00000000  R01=00003200
      R02=00000000  R03=00000000  R04=001fca10  R05=00000000
      R06=00000000  R07=00000000  R08=7fb7e0aa  R09=00000000
      R10=00000000  R11=00000000  R12=00485e60  R13=f0002124
      R14=bfc00308  R15=0000703b ]
     Dump TLB: [
     Entry 00: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     Entry 01: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     Entry 02: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     Entry 03: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     Entry 04: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     Entry 05: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     ...
     Entry 63: (00000fc000000000) V=00000 A=3f P=00000 ndvg
     ]
</pre>
   <p>Each of the R00 .. R15 are coprocessor zero registers, in
hexadecimal.  The Entry 00 .. 63 lines are TLB entries. The 64-bit
number in parentheses is the hexadecimal raw value of the entry. V
is the virtual page number. A is the ASID. P is the physical page
number. NDVG are the Non-cacheable, Dirty, Valid, and Global bits,
uppercase if on, lowercase if off.

   <p><samp><span class="option">haltibe</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">haltibe</span></samp> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
after an instruction fetch causes a bus error (exception
code 6, Instruction bus error). This is useful if you
are expecting execution to jump to nonexistent addresses in
memory, and you want it to stop instead of calling the
exception handler.  It is important to note that the machine
halts after the exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">haltbreak</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">haltbreak</span></samp> is set to TRUE, the virtual machine will halt
when a breakpoint exception is encountered (exception
code 9). This is equivalent to halting when a <code>break</code>
instruction is encountered. It is important to note that the
machine halts after the breakpoint exception is processed.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">haltdevice</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">haltdevice</span></samp> is set to TRUE, the halt device is mapped into
physical memory, otherwise it is not.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">instcounts</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>Set <samp><span class="option">instcounts</span></samp> to TRUE if you want to see instruction
counts, a rough estimate of total runtime, and execution
speed in instructions per second when the virtual
machine halts.  The default value is FALSE.  The output is printed
at the end of the run, and is in the following format:
<pre class="example">     7337 instructions in 0.0581 seconds (126282.271 instructions per second)
</pre>
   <p><samp><span class="option">romfile</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>This is the name of the file which will be initially
loaded into memory (at the address given in <samp><span class="option">loadaddr</span></samp>,
typically 0xbfc00000) and executed when the virtual
machine is reset.  The default value is "romfile.rom".

   <p><samp><span class="option">loadaddr</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>This is the virtual address where the ROM will be loaded. 
Note that the MIPS reset exception vector is always 0xbfc00000
so unless you're doing something incredibly clever you should
plan to have some executable code at that address. Since the
caches and TLB are in an indeterminate state at the time of
reset, the load address must be in uncacheable memory which
is not mapped through the TLB (kernel segment "kseg1"). This
effectively constrains the valid range of load addresses to
between 0xa0000000 and 0xc0000000.  The default value is 0xbfc00000.

   <p><samp><span class="option">memsize</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>This variable controls the size of the virtual CPU's "physical"
memory in bytes.  The default value is 0x100000.

   <p><samp><span class="option">memdump</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">memdump</span></samp> is set, then the virtual machine will dump its RAM
into a file, whose name is given by the <samp><span class="option">memdumpfile</span></samp> option,
at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">memdumpfile</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>This is the name of the file to which a RAM dump will be
written at the end of the simulation run.  The default value is "memdump.bin".

   <p><samp><span class="option">reportirq</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">reportirq</span></samp> is set, then any change in the interrupt
inputs from a device will be reported on stderr. Also, any
Interrupt exception will be reported, if <samp><span class="option">excmsg</span></samp> is also
set.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">spimconsole</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>When set, configure the SPIM-compatible console device. 
This is incompatible with <samp><span class="option">decserial</span></samp>.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">ttydev</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>This pathname will be used as the device from which reads from the
SPIM-compatible console device's Keyboard 1 will take their data, and
to which writes to Display 1 will send their data. If the OS supports
ttyname(3), that call will be used to guess the default pathname. 
If the pathname is the single word `<samp><span class="samp">off</span></samp>', then the device will be
disconnected.  The default value is "/dev/tty".

   <p><samp><span class="option">ttydev2</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>See <samp><span class="option">ttydev</span></samp> option; this one is just like it, but pertains
to Keyboard 2 and Display 2.   The default value is "off".

   <p><samp><span class="option">debug</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If debug is set, then the gdb remote serial protocol backend will
be enabled in the virtual machine. This will cause the machine to
wait for gdb to attach and `<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>' before booting the ROM file. 
If debug is not set, then the machine will boot the ROM file
without pausing.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> is set, then the clock device will cause simulated
time to run at some fraction of real time, determined by the
<samp><span class="option">timeratio</span></samp> option. If realtime is not set, then simulated time
will run at the speed given by the <samp><span class="option">clockspeed</span></samp> option.   The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">timeratio</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>If the <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> option is set, this option gives the
number of times slower than real time at which simulated time will
run. It has no effect if <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> is not set.  The default value is 1.

   <p><samp><span class="option">clockspeed</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>If the <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> option is not set, you should set this
option to the average speed in MIPS instructions per second at which
your system runs VMIPS. You can get suitable values from turning
on the <samp><span class="option">instcounts</span></samp> option and running some of your favorite
programs. If you increase the value of <samp><span class="option">clockspeed</span></samp>, time will
appear to pass more slowly for the simulated machine; if you decrease
it, time will pass more quickly. (To be precise, one instruction is
assumed to take 1.0e9/<samp><span class="option">clockspeed</span></samp> nanoseconds.) This option
has no effect if <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp> is set.  The default value is 250000.

   <p><samp><span class="option">clockintr</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>This option gives the frequency of clock interrupts, in nanoseconds
of simulated time, for the clock device. It does not affect the
DECstation-compatible realtime clock.  The default value is 200000000.

   <p><samp><span class="option">clockdeviceirq</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>This option gives the interrupt line to which the clock device is
connected. Values must be a number 2-7 corresponding to an interrupt
line reserved for use by hardware.  The default value is 7.

   <p><samp><span class="option">clockdevice</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the clock device is enabled. This will
allow MIPS programs to take advantage of a high precision clock.  The default value is TRUE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">dbemsg</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the physical addresses of accesses
that cause data bus errors (DBE exceptions) will be printed.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">decrtc</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the DEC RTC device will be
configured.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">deccsr</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the DEC CSR (Control/Status Register)
will be configured.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">decstat</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the DEC CHKSYN and ERRADR registers
will be configured.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">decserial</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the DEC DZ11 serial device
will be configured. This is incompatible with <samp><span class="option">spimconsole</span></samp>.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">tracing</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, VMIPS will keep a trace of the last few
instructions executed in memory, and write it out when the machine
halts.  This incurs a substantial performance penalty.  Use the
<samp><span class="option">tracesize</span></samp> option to set the size of the trace you want.  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">tracesize</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>Set this option to the maximum number of instructions to keep in the
dynamic instruction trace. This has no effect if <samp><span class="option">tracing</span></samp> is
not set.  The default value is 100000.

   <p><samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp> (type: Boolean)

   <p>If this option is set, then the emulated MIPS CPU will be in
Big-Endian mode.  Otherwise, it will be in Little-Endian mode. You
must set it to correspond to the type of binaries that your
assembler and compiler are configured to produce, which is not
necessarily the same as the endianness of the CPU on which you
are running VMIPS.  (The default may not be meaningful for your
setup!)  The default value is FALSE.

   <p><samp><span class="option">tracestartpc</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>If the tracing option is set, then this is the PC at which tracing
will start. Otherwise it has no effect.  The default value is 0.

   <p><samp><span class="option">traceendpc</span></samp> (type: number)

   <p>If the tracing option is set, then this is the PC at which tracing
will stop. Otherwise it has no effect.  The default value is 0.

   <p><samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>vmipstool uses this option to locate your MIPS-targetted cross
compilation tools, if you have them installed. If your MIPS GCC
is installed as /opt/mips/bin/mips-elf-gcc, then you should set
this option to "/opt/mips/bin/mips-elf-". vmipstool looks for
the "gcc", "ld", "objcopy" and "objdump" programs starting with
this prefix. This option should be set in your installed
system-wide VMIPS configuration file (vmipsrc) by the "configure"
script; the compiled-in default is designed to cause an error.  The default value is "/nonexistent/mips/bin/mipsel-ecoff-".

   <p><samp><span class="option">execname</span></samp> (type: string)

   <p>Name of executable to be loaded by automatic kernel loader. This
is an experimental feature. The option value must be the name of
a MIPS ECOFF executable file, or 'none' to disable the option. 
The executable's headers must specify load addresses in KSEG0
or KSEG1 (0x80000000 through 0xbfffffff).   The default value is "none".

<h2 class="chapter">8 Programming</h2>

<p>In this section we attempt to give some hints about writing code for
VMIPS.  They are primarily intended for assembly language programmers,
but should be helpful to anyone interested in the MIPS
architecture. This section will not replace a good MIPS reference; check
the &ldquo;References&rdquo; section for more information about these. However, any
help is appreciated for making this section more complete.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Delay slot handling</h3>

<p>MIPS branch instructions' effects are delayed by one instruction;
the instruction following the branch instruction is always executed,
regardless of whether the branch is taken. This is a consequence of
the pipeline which is not important to virtual machine architecture,
except that it has to be emulated correctly.

   <p>VMIPS emulates delay slot handling by means of a tiny state machine, whose
state is called the delay state.  The virtual CPU can be in a delay state
of <code>DELAYING</code>, <code>DELAYSLOT</code>, or <code>NORMAL</code> at the beginning
of the call to <code>periodic()</code>. The VMIPS delay slot state machine's state
is displayed when you use the <samp><span class="option">dumpcpu</span></samp> option. See the &ldquo;Summary
of configuration options&rdquo; section of the &ldquo;Customizing&rdquo; chapter for more
information about this option.

   <p>A delay state of <code>NORMAL</code> corresponds to execution in the non-branch case.

   <p>A delay state of <code>DELAYING</code> means that the instruction being executed
caused a branch to be taken, and the next instruction to execute is in
the delay slot.

   <p>A delay state of <code>DELAYSLOT</code> means that the instruction just executed
was in the delay slot, and the next instruction to execute is the
branch target.  If there is an exception, the exception PC will be the
PC of the branch instruction, not of this one.

<h2 class="chapter">9 Debugging</h2>

<p>VMIPS supports debugging programs running on the virtual machine by
providing an interface to GDB, the GNU debugger.  GDB talks to VMIPS using
its built-in remote serial protocol, over a local TCP connection.  See the
&ldquo;Remote Serial&rdquo; section of the GDB manual for details of the protocol.

   <p>You must use a MIPS-targetted GDB to debug programs running on VMIPS;
that is, you must use a copy of GDB that understands MIPS assembly
language and registers.  Usually, a copy of GDB configured this way will
have a name starting with <samp><span class="file">mips</span></samp>, e.g., <samp><span class="file">mipsel-ecoff-gdb</span></samp>. 
See the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section of the manual for more information on
configuring and building a MIPS-targetted GDB.

   <p>If you want to take advantage of the VMIPS GDB interface, set the `<samp><span class="samp">debug</span></samp>'
flag on the command line. VMIPS will wait for you to attach GDB and type
`<samp><span class="samp">continue</span></samp>' at the GDB prompt before booting the ROM file.

   <p>To attach GDB to VMIPS, look for the line in the VMIPS startup message that
reads:

<pre class="example">     Use this command to attach debugger: target remote 127.0.0.1:3371
</pre>
   <p>(The host and port numbers (127.0.0.1:3371) may be different on your
machine.)  When VMIPS pauses and says `<samp><span class="samp">Waiting for connection from
debugger</span></samp>', open up GDB in another window or on another terminal on the
program you are debugging. Do not try to open GDB on the ROM file,
because GDB doesn't understand ROM files; rather, give GDB the name of
the program you used to create the ROM file. Then type the `<samp><span class="samp">target remote</span></samp>'
command that VMIPS printed out, and GDB will connect to VMIPS, which will
be stopped at the first instruction of your setup code. Then you can set
breakpoints, single step, or just let the program continue. VMIPS will return
control to GDB on exceptions.

   <p>Here is what the whole setup process looks like in VMIPS:

<pre class="example">     % ./vmips -o debug boot.rom
     Auto-size ROM image: 4096 words.
     Running self tests.
     Little-Endian host processor detected.
     Self tests passed.

   <h3 class="section">9.1 GDB, VMIPS and Signals</h3>

<p>Since VMIPS does not know what operating system you are running on it, and GDB
does not believe in hardware exceptions (only operating system signals), VMIPS
has its own mapping of hardware exceptions to signals.

   <p>The mapping is as follows: Each signal is followed by a list of the hardware
exceptions that map to it.

     <dl>
<dt><var>SIGINT</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>Interrupt
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGSEGV</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>TLB modification exception
<li>TLB exception (load or instruction fetch)
<li>TLB exception (store)
<li>Address error exception (load or instruction fetch)
<li>Address error exception (store)
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGBUS</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>Instruction bus error
<li>Data (load or store) bus error
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGTRAP</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>SYSCALL exception
<li>Breakpoint exception (BREAK instruction)
<li>Processor reset (only at VMIPS startup)
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGILL</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>Reserved instruction exception
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGFPE</var><dd>

<li>Coprocessor Unusable
<li>Arithmetic Overflow
</ul>

     <br><dt><var>SIGHUP</var><dd>
          <ul>
<li>(Anything else.) 
</ul>
     </dl>

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.1 Startup behavior</h4>

<p>Upon connecting to the VMIPS socket, gdb asks for the number of the
signal that stopped VMIPS. Of course, there was no exception, since no
instructions have executed, but we have to give a reason anyway. The
signal that is always returned is the signal corresponding to the
breakpoint exception &ndash; hence the listing for processor reset in the
signal table above, even though reset is not really an ordinary exception.

<h3 class="section">9.2 GDB remote serial protocol implementation</h3>

<p>The GDB remote serial protocol supports lots of packets, but VMIPS does
not support all of them.  The following subset of the GDB remote serial
protocol is implemented.

     <ul>
<li>packet 'g': Read registers
<li>packet 'G': Write registers
<li>packet 'm': Read memory
<li>packet 'M': Write memory
<li>packet 'c': Continue
<li>packet 's': Single step
<li>packet 'k': Kill target
<li>packet 'H': Set thread
<li>packet '?': What was the last signal? 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">9.3 ROM Breakpoints</h3>

<p><a name="index-ROM_002c-breakpoints-in-42"></a>VMIPS supports the setting of breakpoints in ROM.  This would not be
extraordinary except that MIPS breakpoints are usually implemented by
GDB's remote serial protocol by overwriting instructions with MIPS break
instructions. VMIPS keeps a single bit for each word of ROM, in order
to tell whether that instruction is really a breakpoint. GDB keeps track
of setting and unsetting the breakpoints.

<h3 class="section">9.4 Using Insight as a GUI for VMIPS</h3>

<p><a name="index-Insight-43"></a><a name="index-GUI_002c-using-Insight-44"></a>You can use the Insight graphical front end for GDB as a graphical front end
for VMIPS.

   <p>As with GDB, you must use a MIPS-targetted Insight to debug programs
running on VMIPS; that is, you must use a copy of Insight that
understands MIPS assembly language and registers.  Usually, a copy of
Insight configured this way will have a name starting with <samp><span class="file">mips</span></samp>,
e.g., <samp><span class="file">mipsel-ecoff-gdb</span></samp>. (Confusingly, Insight binaries are also
named <samp><span class="file">gdb</span></samp>.)

   <p>Now let's walk through an example scenario where we want to
use Insight to debug a program running in ROM on VMIPS.

   <p>1. Start VMIPS using the <samp><span class="option">-o debug</span></samp> command line flag, to activate the
debugging interface, and specify the name of the ROM file containing the ROM
you want to debug.

   <p>2. Start Insight.

   <p>3. Choose Open... from the File menu. Select the executable file corresponding
to the ROM file you just loaded in to VMIPS.

   <p>4. VMIPS will have printed out a message like:
<pre class="example">     Use this command to attach debugger: target remote 127.0.0.1:3082
</pre>
   <p>To tell Insight what to do, choose Target Settings... from the File menu. 
In the Connection panel, set the Target to Remote/TCP, and set the Hostname to
127.0.0.1, and set the Port to 3082. Then hit OK.

   <p>5.  Now, choose Connect to target from the Run menu. This will probably
bring up a dialog box affirming that the connection was successful. 
Now you can look at registers, step through code, and whatnot, till your
heart's content.

<h2 class="chapter">10 Devices</h2>

<p>VMIPS comes with a few standard devices.

<h3 class="section">10.1 SPIM-compatible console device</h3>

<p>The SPIM-compatible Console Device models a serial controller with
two 200-baud full-duplex communication lines and a 1 Hz clock providing
timer interrupts. This console device is currently the standard console
device used in VMIPS.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.1 Memory-mapped registers</h4>

<p>The SPIM-compatible console device communicates with the CPU by means
of a series of 9 32-bit-wide control and data registers, for a total
of 36 memory-mapped bytes. The control registers are used for enabling
and disabling specific devices' interrupt request mechanisms, and for
determining which device(s) is/are ready for data when polling or during
interrupt processing.

   <p>The following table details the offset of each register within the
console device's mapped memory:

   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x00 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Keyboard 1 Control
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x04 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Keyboard 1 Data
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x08 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Display 1 Control
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x0c </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Display 1 Data
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x10 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Keyboard 2 Control
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x14 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Keyboard 2 Data
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x18 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Display 2 Control
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x1c </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Display 2 Data
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top" width="20%">offset 0x20 </td><td valign="top" width="40%">Clock Control
   <br></td></tr></table>

   <p>Within each control register, Bit 2 of each word is the Device
Interrupt Enable bit, and bit 1 is the Device Ready bit.  Only the
Device Interrupt Enable bits of the control registers are writable;
other bits must be written as zero. Only Device Interrupt Enable and
Device Ready are readable; other bits read as zero. Initially the
Interrupt Enable bits on all SPIM console control words are unset.

   <p>Within each data register, writes are allowed only to the
least-significant 8 bits; the other 24 bits read as zero and must be
written as zero.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.2 Interrupts</h4>

<p>With a SPIM-compatible Console Device configured, the following interrupt
lines are enabled.

<pre class="display">     Interrupt line 2 (Cause bit 0x0400) is wired to the Clock
     Interrupt line 3 (Cause bit 0x0800) is wired to the #1 Keyboard
     Interrupt line 4 (Cause bit 0x1000) is wired to the #1 Display
     Interrupt line 5 (Cause bit 0x2000) is wired to the #2 Keyboard
     Interrupt line 6 (Cause bit 0x4000) is wired to the #2 Display
</pre>
   <p>When any one of the console devices is both ready and has its Device
Interrupt Enable bit set, it requests an interrupt.  (You must have the
interrupt mask and interrupt enable bits of the CP0 Status register set
for this request to succeed.) It follows that if the device becomes ready
and then the user sets the Device Interrupt Enable bit, the device will
immediately attempt to request an interrupt.  You can determine which
device requested the interrupt by examining the Interrupt Pending field
of the CP0 Cause register in your interrupt handler code.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.3 Display</h4>

<p>The display data register is write-only. 
On a write to the data register, the display becomes unready and writes
a char to the connected serial interface; it becomes ready again in 40
ms.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.4 Clock</h4>

<p>The Clock has no data register and becomes ready at most every second. A
read from the Clock Control register makes the clock unready. Writes to
the clock control register are as above.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.5 Keyboard</h4>

<p>The keyboard is initially unready; whenever the connected serial
interface has a byte waiting on input, and the keyboard is unready,
the keyboard reads the byte into its buffer, and becomes ready. If the
keyboard is ready for more than 40 ms., it will check the connected
serial interface again.  If there is another byte available, it will
read it and save it in the buffer, writing over the one which was
originally in the buffer. No provision is made for detection of these
buffer overruns.  Updates to the keyboard buffer happen at most once
per instruction fetched.

   <p>The keyboard data register is read-only.  On a read from the data
register, if the keyboard is ready it becomes unready and returns the
byte in its holding buffer. If the keyboard data register is read while
the keyboard is unready, the data in the buffer is the same as when
the keyboard was last ready.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.6 Compatibility</h4>

<p>The SPIM-compatible console device is based on the SPIMSAL 4.4.2 version,
which generally provides a superset of the functionality of the console
device provided in SPIM 5.x and 6.x.

   <p>In SPIM 5.x/6.x, the keyboard controller appears at virtual address
0xffff0000. Keyboard 2, Display 2 and the Clock device are not available. 
(This is the same layout used in Patterson and Hennessy's Computer
Organization and Design textbook.)  Therefore, in order to get compatible
behavior from the VMIPS SPIM-compatible console device, your startup
code should configure the TLB to map virtual page number 0xffff0 to the
physical addresses where the SPIM-compatible console device is configured.

   <p>In SPIM, when you read or write to a memory-mapped I/O register, only the
virtual address and the data value stored are considered, not the width
of the access.  This means that on a big-endian machine, you can (for
example) write the display at the most-significant byte of the display
data word (using a store byte instruction), or at the least-significant
byte of the word (using a store word instruction). In VMIPS, you must
always write the least-significant byte.

   <p>In SPIMSAL, it is believed to be the case that reads always read from
keyboard 1, never from keyboard 2; whereas the user may write to either
display, but data written to either display are invariably written to
the simulator's standard output. Compatibility with these bugs is not
supported.

<h4 class="subsection">10.1.7 Disconnected operation</h4>

<p>The SPIM console device can be configured to turn off either the first or
the second display/keyboard pair. Use the special keyword <samp><span class="option">off</span></samp> in
place of a device name, e.g., `<samp><span class="samp">-o ttydev=off</span></samp>', to turn off a console
line. When a console line is turned off, it is described as `disconnected',
and behaves as follows:

     <ul>
<li>Interrupts can be turned on and off as usual. 
<li>A disconnected keyboard always has Device Ready clear and always
returns ASCII NULs (zero bytes) when its data word is read. 
<li>A disconnected display discards bytes written to it, and always
has Device Ready set, but if its interrupts are turned on, it will not
generate an interrupt. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">10.2 Standard clock device</h3>

<p>This section documents the standard clock device for VMIPS. It is intended
to support user programs' access to real and simulated time.  The clock
device supports a hardware clock interrupt to notify MIPS programs of the
passage of a prespecified number of nanoseconds, determined by the user's
setting of the <samp><span class="option">clockintr</span></samp> option. This clock provides a much
higher resolution than the SPIM-compatible console device's 1Hz clock. 
The clock is enabled or disabled with the <samp><span class="option">clockdevice</span></samp> option.

<h4 class="subsection">10.2.1 Memory-mapped registers</h4>

<p>The standard clock device has 5 registers, configured to be mapped into
memory at address 0xa1010000. The following table defines the layout of
the memory-mapped clock device registers:

     <dl>
<dt><code>offset 0x00</code><dd>real time, seconds

     <br><dt><code>offset 0x04</code><dd>real time, microseconds

     <br><dt><code>offset 0x08</code><dd>simulated time, seconds

     <br><dt><code>offset 0x0c</code><dd>simulated time, microseconds

     <br><dt><code>offset 0x10</code><dd>control word
</dl>

   <p>Writing any of the clock's real time words is undefined. Writing a clock's
simulated time word sets that component of the simulated time if the number
written is a non-negative signed integer, otherwise there is no effect.

   <p>The control word has 32 bits. Bit 2 of the cotrol word is the interrupt
enable bit (<code>CTL_IE</code> is defined as 0x00000002) and bit 1 is the device
ready bit (<code>CTL_RDY</code> is defined as 0x00000001). All other bits in the
control word are currently reserved and read as zero. Writing any of the
other bits of the control word is undefined. The interrupt enable bit
in the clock device control word is initially unset.

<h4 class="subsection">10.2.2 Interrupts</h4>

<p>The standard clock device is connected to the hardware interrupt
line specified by the <samp><span class="option">clockdeviceirq</span></samp> option, which must be a
number corresponding to an interrupt line reserved for use by hardware
(2 through 7). See the &ldquo;Summary of configuration options&rdquo; section of
the &ldquo;Customizing&rdquo; chapter for more information.  The clock requests an
interrupt whenever the clock is in the ready state and the interrupt
enable bit on the control word is set.

   <p>The <samp><span class="option">clockintr</span></samp> option gives the frequency of clock interrupts in
nanoseconds of simulated time. See the &ldquo;Summary of configuration options&rdquo;
section of the &ldquo;Customizing&rdquo; chapter for more information.

<h4 class="subsection">10.2.3 Real vs. simulated time</h4>

<p>Real time is obtained from the host's <code>gettimeofday(2)</code> system
call, so it should be close to the host's view of the current time. No
sophisticated algorithms are used to calibrate the real time clock, so
it will drift a little.

   <p>The speed of simulated time is determined by the <samp><span class="option">realtime</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="option">timeratio</span></samp>, and <samp><span class="option">clockintr</span></samp> options. See the &ldquo;Summary
of configuration options&rdquo; section of the &ldquo;Customizing&rdquo; chapter for more
information. Increasing the speed of simulated time will most likely
make the simulation run more slowly because it will increase the average
number of system calls per instruction.

<h3 class="section">10.3 Halt device</h3>

<p>This section documents the halt device. It is provided so that simulated
operating systems can stop the simulator in a controlled manner, without
having to rely on specific instructions or exceptional conditions. The
halt device is enabled or disabled with the <samp><span class="option">haltdevice</span></samp> option.

<h4 class="subsection">10.3.1 Memory-mapped registers</h4>

<p>The halt device has 1 register, configured to be mapped into memory at
address 0x01010024. The following table defines the layout of the
memory-mapped halt device register:

     <dl>
<dt><code>offset 0x00</code><dd>control word

   </dl>

   <p>Writing a non-zero value to the halt device control word halts the
simulation. Writing zero has no effect. The control word is always read
as zero.

<h3 class="section">10.4 DECstation 5000/200-compatible devices</h3>

<p>VMIPS contains partial support for the built-in memory-mapped devices on the
motherboard of the Digital Equipment DECstation 5000/200.  This support should
be considered "beta" quality in this release.   All the DECstation-compatible
devices are disabled by default; see the options starting with <samp><span class="option">dec</span></samp> in
the Customizing chapter for information about how to turn them on.

   <p>The following devices are supported:

     <ul>
<li>DECstation 5000/200's Dallas Semiconductor DS1287-based real-time
clock (RTC) chip (use <samp><span class="option">-o decrtc</span></samp> to enable; mapped into memory

<h2 class="chapter">11 Extending</h2>

<p>This chapter is intended to be a hacker's guide to adding or modifying
VMIPS functionality.

<h3 class="section">11.1 Road map to the VMIPS source code</h3>

<p>This section is intended to help interested persons find various things
in the VMIPS source code, and get a general idea of how the various
software modules are structured.

   <p>The processing of command-line options and of options in your
<samp><span class="file">.vmipsrc</span></samp> is directed by routines in <samp><span class="file">options.cc</span></samp> and in class
<code>Options</code>. The default options and the option documentation is all
in <samp><span class="file">optiontbl.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The memory mapping unit has a high-level interface to the rest of
the code, which is defined in <samp><span class="file">mapper.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">mapper.h</span></samp>,
and in class <code>Mapper</code>.  The memory mapping unit uses a bunch of
low-level data structures, which are defined in <samp><span class="file">range.cc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">range.h</span></samp>, in class <code>Range</code>. This is
meant to be logically and physically separate from the TLB, which is
implemented as part of the system control coprocessor.  The actual chunks
of host virtual memory which are used for the virtual machine's physical
memory are encapsulated in class <code>MemoryModule</code>, which is implemented in
<samp><span class="file">memorymodule.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The system control coprocessor (MIPS coprocessor zero) and the
TLB are implemented in <samp><span class="file">cpzero.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">cpzero.h</span></samp>, as
class <code>CPZero</code>. The structure of TLB entries is defined in
<samp><span class="file">tlbentry.h</span></samp>, and constants related to the
register set of MIPS coprocessor zero are defined in <samp><span class="file">cpzeroreg.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The CPU (class <code>CPU</code>) and the default exception handling behavior are
implemented in <samp><span class="file">cpu.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">cpu.h</span></samp>. Exception handling behavior
is an interface described by class DeviceExc (in <samp><span class="file">deviceexc.h</span></samp>);
this class provides for the <code>exception</code> instance method and its
implementations in class <code>CPU</code> and class <code>Debug</code>. 
Constants for the different kinds of exceptions which are implemented
by MIPS processors are defined in <samp><span class="file">excnames.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The disassembler uses code from GNU libopcodes (part of GNU
Binutils); it is located in the <samp><span class="file">libopcodes_mips</span></samp> directory. 
The high-level C++ interface to the disassembler is in <samp><span class="file">stub-dis.cc</span></samp>.

   <p>The GNU debugger interface is separated into a high-level part (which
deals with the various debugger requests) in <samp><span class="file">debug.cc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">debug.h</span></samp>, and a low-level part (which assembles and disassembles
the GDB remote serial protocol packets), in <samp><span class="file">remotegdb.cc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">remotegdb.h</span></samp>.

   <p>A few parts of the VMIPS system have a central procedure which needs
to be run periodically in a loop in order to update the part of the
simulation that they are responsible for.  These parts typically have
instance methods named <code>step()</code>. The <code>CPU</code> class, for example,
fetches, decodes, and executes one instruction each time its <code>step()</code>
function is called.

   <p>The <code>vmips</code> class, implemented in <samp><span class="file">vmips.cc</span></samp>, is used to tie
all the components of the system together.  This class, and specifically
its <code>run()</code> member function, is responsible for setting up
and configuring all system components and calling the <code>step()</code>
member function(s).  The vmips class is not a very smart or a very
flexible configuration mechanism; it will eventually be replaced with
a configuration language of some sort.

   <p>The simulator's idea of time is managed by classes in <samp><span class="file">clock.cc</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">clock.h</span></samp>. VMIPS programs gain access to the simulated clock by using
the memory-mapped clock device, which is implemented in files
<samp><span class="file">clockdev.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">clockdev.h</span></samp>, and whose register map is available
in <samp><span class="file">clockreg.h</span></samp>. The clock manages tasks, which are basically function
objects that can be cancelled or fire at a later time. Tasks are defined in
<samp><span class="file">task.h</span></samp>.

   <p>VMIPS provides standard error-reporting functions, which your code can use. 
They are defined in <samp><span class="file">error.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">error.h</span></samp>.

   <p>Some of VMIPS's simulated devices share common semantics for control
register bits, constants for which are defined in <samp><span class="file">devreg.h</span></samp>.

   <p>VMIPS provides a halt device, which can halt the machine even when the
options such as <samp><span class="file">haltbreak</span></samp> are turned off.  It is implemented in
<samp><span class="file">haltdev.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">haltdev.h</span></samp>, and its register map is defined
in <samp><span class="file">haltreg.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The SPIM-compatible console device (implemented in <samp><span class="file">spimconsole.cc</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">spimconsole.h</span></samp>, with a register map in <samp><span class="file">spimconsreg.h</span></samp>)
is based on a generic terminal controller, which is implemented in
<samp><span class="file">terminalcontroller.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">terminalcontroller.h</span></samp>.

   <p>The various DECstation-compatible devices are implemented in the files whose
names start with <samp><span class="file">dec</span></samp>.

   <p><a name="index-ROM-bootstrap-loader-45"></a><a name="index-ROM-monitor-46"></a>The ROM bootstrap loader code (also known as the ROM monitor) is in
the directory <samp><span class="file">sample_code/xmboot</span></samp>.  The current ROM monitor loads
ECOFF binary files using the XMODEM upload protocol, and also boots
files which have been embedded inside of it with the <samp><span class="file">catrom</span></samp> Perl
script.

   <p>The manual, and any random bits of hacking information which have not
yet been incorporated into the manual, are in the directory <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp>.

   <p>The VMIPS automated regression test suite is in the directory
<samp><span class="file">test_code</span></samp>. Some interesting sample code, including the canned ROM
setup code used to build ROM files out of C programs for the test suite,
is in the directory <samp><span class="file">sample_code</span></samp>.

   <p>Various scripts used by the maintainers to help maintain the code are
in the directory <samp><span class="file">utils</span></samp>.

   <p>VMIPS provides a simple front-end to GNU MIPS cross-compilation tools,
called Vmipstool. Its implementation is in the file <samp><span class="file">vmipstool.cc</span></samp>;
it shares a little bit of options- and error-handling code with VMIPS.

   <p>Interfaces to the host system's C++ standard library are included in
<samp><span class="file">sysinclude.h</span></samp>. <samp><span class="file">wipe.h</span></samp> is a template utility function used
for deleting all the objects contained in standard C++ containers.

   <p>Please read the rest of this chapter for information about the rest
of the files in the VMIPS source directory.

<h3 class="section">11.2 Endianness issues</h3>

<p>When you are making extensions to VMIPS, it is important not to assume that
your host processor is little-endian (or to assume that it is big-endian). One
of the first things that VMIPS does when it starts is to determine the
endianness of the host processor. The endianness of the VMIPS target processor
is determined by the <samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp> command-line option. Your extension
can query the <code>machine-&gt;host_bigendian</code> flag to determine whether the
host processor is big-endian or not, and it can query the <samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp>
command-line option, via the public interface of class <code>Options</code>,
to determine whether the VMIPS target processor is big-endian or not.

   <p>The physical memory system (class <code>Mapper</code>) defines some convenience
methods which you can use. You can call the <code>swap_word()</code> or
<code>swap_halfword()</code> methods of class <code>Mapper</code>, or the wrapper functions
<code>host_to_mips_word()</code> and <code>mips_to_host_word()</code>, to do endianness
translation between the host machine and target machine, when necessary.

   <p>When you define memory-mapped devices, you should return data to
the Mapper in host endianness. It is recommended that memory-mapped devices
also store their data in host endianness, unless there is a good reason.

<h3 class="section">11.3 Memory-Mapped Devices</h3>

<p>Memory-mapped devices must inherit from class <code>DeviceMap</code>, which
is defined in the files <samp><span class="file">devicemap.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">devicemap.h</span></samp>
in the VMIPS source directory.

   <p>Memory-mapped devices must have a constructor and a destructor. The
constructor must call the DeviceMap constructor with a single parameter,
called <var>extent</var>. It should be equal to the number of
bytes which are mapped into the processor's memory; this figure must be
a multiple of 4. The device must also override the following abstract
methods:

<pre class="example">     uint32 fetch_word(uint32 offset, int mode, DeviceExc *client);
     uint32 store_word(uint32 offset, uint32 data, DeviceExc *client);
</pre>
   <p>The meanings of the parameters are as follows:

     <dl>
<dt><var>offset</var><dd>Byte offset from the beginning of the device's memory-mapped region that is
being read or written. The width of the read (fetch) or write (store)
is either a word (4 bytes), halfword (2 bytes), or a single byte,
depending on the call. Since this value is a byte offset, if you want to
figure out which word of your device is being accessed, you should
divide it by 4.

     <br><dt><var>mode</var><dd>This tells you whether the memory access is a data load
(<code>DATALOAD</code>), data store (<code>DATASTORE</code>), or instruction
fetch (<code>INSTFETCH</code>). These constants are defined in
<samp><span class="file">accesstypes.h</span></samp>. For narrow (&lt; 1 word) fetches, the mode is always
<code>DATALOAD</code>. For stores, the mode is always <code>DATASTORE</code>. 
The only case in which this is ambiguous is for the <code>fetch_word</code>
case, where mode may be either <code>DATALOAD</code> or <code>INSTFETCH</code>. 
Most devices do not need to bother with the mode, except when there is an
illegal access. See the section on exception behavior, below.

     <br><dt><var>client</var><dd>Every memory access is requested by a client, which is responsible for
handling any exceptions which may arise. Any component of the VMIPS
system which may access memory must either inherit from class <code>DeviceExc</code>
(i.e., &ldquo;a device which may handle exceptions&rdquo;), or have a pointer to a device
which does. See the section on exception behavior, below.

     <br><dt><var>data</var><dd>When the client is storing a value, you will receive the value as the
<var>data</var> parameter. 
</dl>

<h3 class="section">11.4 Exception behavior</h3>

<p>Whenever there is an exception,
the device must make the call
<pre class="example">     client-&gt;exception(type, mode);
</pre>
   <p>whose precise prototype is defined in <samp><span class="file">deviceexc.h</span></samp>.

   <p><var>Type</var> must be one of the standard MIPS exception codes, which are
defined in <samp><span class="file">cpzeroreg.h</span></samp>, and elsewhere in this manual. <var>Mode</var>
is the mode of the memory access; see the table entry for <var>mode</var>
above.

   <p>Please note that you should not call the <code>exception</code> method in
order to generate a hardware interrupt (i.e., the Interrupt exception). 
Interrupts are managed by class <code>IntCtrl</code>, and your device should
call the <code>assertInt</code> function to generate them.  See the
&ldquo;Interrupt-generating devices&rdquo; section for more details on what you
should do. If you are curious about the inner workings of the interrupt
controller, you can read its source in <samp><span class="file">intctrl.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">intctrl.h</span></samp>.

<h4 class="subsection">11.4.1 Coprocessors</h4>

<p>If your device is part of a MIPS coprocessor, you should pass a third
argument to the <code>client-&gt;exception()</code> call, which is the number of
the coprocessor; it may meaningfully be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Ordinarily, that
is to say in situations not involving coprocessors, this parameter
defaults to -1 and does not need to be specified explicitly.

   <p><a name="index-coprocessor-zero-47"></a>Coprocessor 0 is the MIPS system control coprocessor, responsible for
TLB and paging management. It is implemented as class <code>CPZero</code> in
<samp><span class="file">cpzero.cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">cpzero.h</span></samp>. It has 16 registers, each of which
has some read-only bits and some read/write bits. Extension code should
not attempt to misrepresent itself as being coprocessor zero without a
good reason.

   <p><a name="index-registers_002c-read_002donly-48"></a>One of the jobs of the <code>CPZero</code> class is to ensure that attempts to
write to these registers are only allowed to write to the bits which
are writable, so if you are interested in implementing read-only  and
read/write registers in your virtual hardware, look through <samp><span class="file">cpzero.cc</span></samp>
for <var>read_masks</var> and <var>write_masks</var>.

   <p><a name="index-coprocessors_002c-floating_002dpoint-49"></a>Coprocessor 1 is the floating point coprocessor, but it is not
implemented. It may, however, be implemented in the future. Volunteers
to begin such a task would be more than welcome.

   <p><a name="index-coprocessors_002c-default-behavior-50"></a>The default behavior of MIPS coprocessors 1, 2, and 3 in the VMIPS system
is to assume that they are not connected to the system and that accesses
to them should therefore trigger the <code>CpU</code> (Coprocessor Unusable)
exception.

<h3 class="section">11.5 Mapping memory-mapped devices</h3>

<p>You can map each memory-mapped device at a single physical address in the
machine's memory.  The instantiation process is as follows: Assume
that <code>TestDev</code> is a memory-mapped device class which derives from
class <code>DeviceMap</code>, that <var>testdev</var> is an instance of class
<code>TestDev</code>, and that <var>physmem</var> is a <code>Mapper</code> (memory
manager) object.

<pre class="example">      	/* Test device at base phys addr 0x01000000 */
      	testdev = new TestDev();
      	physmem-&gt;add_device_mapping(testdev, 0x01000000);
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-memory_002dmapped-devices_002c-configuring-51"></a><a name="index-memory_002dmapped-devices_002c-specifying-addresses-for-52"></a>A device should have a single base address;
you should have a single call to the Mapper instance
method <code>add_device_mapping(device, addr)</code> to set it. 
<var>device</var> is an instance of a class deriving from class
<code>DeviceMap</code>. <var>addr</var> is the physical address where you want the
device to appear in memory.

   <p>This code is generally executed as part of the <code>vmips-&gt;run()</code>
method in <samp><span class="file">vmips.cc</span></samp>. Look there for more information and some
examples of what to do.

<h3 class="section">11.6 Interrupt-generating devices</h3>

<p><a name="index-interrupts-53"></a>VMIPS provides support for virtual devices that generate hardware
interrupts to communicate with the processor. These virtual devices should
inherit from class <code>DeviceInt</code> (defined in <samp><span class="file">deviceint.h</span></samp>). This
section outlines some information about how to write such virtual devices.

<h4 class="subsection">11.6.1 Connecting devices to the interrupt controller</h4>

<p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-request-lines-for-54"></a>There are 8 interrupt lines in the R3000/R3000A, 6 of which (7..2) are
hardware interrupts (readable by software), and the other 2 of which
(1..0) are software interrupts (readable/writable by software).

   <p>The class <code>IntCtrl</code> instance method <code>connectLine(irq,
device)</code> is used in <samp><span class="file">vmips.cc</span></samp> to notify the interrupt
controller and the device that the interrupt line specified by <var>irq</var>
is connected to <var>device</var>.  <var>irq</var> must be one of the hardware
interrupt constants defined in <samp><span class="file">deviceint.h</span></samp> and <var>device</var>
must be an object of a class deriving from <code>DeviceInt</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">11.6.2 Generating and cancelling interrupt requests</h4>

<p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-generating-requests-for-55"></a>The class <code>DeviceInt</code> instance method <code>assertInt(irq)</code> is used
to request an interrupt from the processor.  Your device should only
request interrupts that have previously been connected to it using the
interrupt controller (see above). Your device may share an interrupt
request line with another device.  In practical terms, asserting an
interrupt request line will cause a trap to the general exception vector
before the next instruction.  If your device asserts an interrupt,
it stays asserted until it is explicitly de-asserted.

   <p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-cancelling-requests-for-56"></a>The instance method <code>deassertInt(irq)</code> will turn off
the interrupt request for your device; this should be done when the
condition that caused the device to request an interrupt has become
satisfied. Note that this does not necessarily imply that the interrupt
request for the processor will be turned off, as there may be another
device trying to use that interrupt request line.

   <p>For both calls, the IRQ parameter must be one of the hardware interrupt
constants defined in <samp><span class="file">deviceint.h</span></samp>.  It is not a good idea to use the
general <code>exception()</code> method to cause interrupt exceptions, because this
could cause excess interrupts to be generated.

   <p>The place where you should make these calls and do these checks is when
your device's code is called through the <code>periodic()</code>
callback. Your device will get <code>periodic()</code> calls fairly often.

<h4 class="subsection">11.6.3 Software interrupts vs. hardware interrupts</h4>

<p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-reserved-for-software-57"></a>Two of the interrupt lines (IRQ 0 and 1) are reserved for software
use. Only the interrupts which are not reserved for software use (IRQ
2 through 7) may be triggered by VMIPS devices.

<h4 class="subsection">11.6.4 Turning interrupts off and on</h4>

<p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-enabling-and-disabling-58"></a>There is a global Interrupt Enable bit for the whole system; this is the
IEc (Interrupt Enable (current)) bit, bit 0 (mask 0x001) of the Status
register (coprocessor zero register 12).  If this bit is turned off,
no interrupt will be triggered. Be sure to turn on your Interrupt Enable
and Interrupt Mask (below) bits when you are testing your new
interrupt-generating device.

   <p><a name="index-interrupts_002c-masking-59"></a>Additionally, bits 15 - 8 (mask 0x0ff00) of the Status register are
individual Interrupt Mask bits. Each bit represents a global interrupt
enable/disable bit for the entire system per interrupt-request line. For
example, if you turn off bit 10 of this register (mask 0x0400), the IRQ2
line will be disabled for the whole system.

   <p>Finally, it is not uncommon for individual devices to have their own
interrupt enable/disable bits that you can set or clear. See the
documentation for each individual device for more information.

<h3 class="section">11.7 Error reporting</h3>

<p>When your code needs to emit warning or error messages, we recommend
you use the following functions from <samp><span class="file">error.cc</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     	void error(const char *msg, ...) throw();
     	void fatal_error(const char *msg, ...) throw();
     	void warning(const char *msg, ...) throw();
</pre>
   <p><code>fatal_error</code> will result in a call to abort() after printing the
error message.  All of these functions will print a newline after MSG.

<h3 class="section">11.8 Weird things</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">11.8.1 Branch on Coprocessor Zero True/False</h4>

<p><a name="index-coprocessor-zero_002c-branch-instructions-60"></a><a name="index-system-control-coprocessor_002c-branch-instructions-61"></a>These instructions are not supposed to cause reserved instruction
exceptions, even though the behavior of BC0F and BC0T instructions on
MIPS-1 machines is not specified in most canonical references.

   <p>On some DEC MIPS machines, the coprocessor 0 condition bit (which BC0F
and BC0T test) is wired to the external write-buffer-empty bit; that is,
when all stores have completed, the write buffer becomes empty, and the
bit goes to true. This makes it possible for a hacker to write the line
`<samp><span class="samp">1: bc0f 1b</span></samp>' and thereby loop until the write buffer is empty.  However,
this is not true of all DECstations, or of the Sony NEWS 3400.

   <p>The coprocessor zero condition bit has an entirely different use on the
R4400 and compatible processors; it is used to tell when you got a cache
hit with a CACHE operation. The R10000 also implements this condition,
but the bit is not wired to the coprocessor zero condition.

   <p>Since VMIPS does not support CACHE operations, and does not have a write
buffer, VMIPS emulates the case where the CpCond bit for CP0 is always
TRUE, i.e., applications that look for the writebuffer will find that
it is always empty.

<h2 class="chapter">12 Test Suite</h2>

<p>VMIPS has a test suite with a small number of regression tests.  It uses the
DejaGNU test framework, which is written in the Expect language.  Expect was
written by Don Libes, and is a dialect of Tcl, the Tool Command Language by
Ousterhout et al.

<h4 class="subsection">12.0.1 How to run the test suite</h4>

<p>In order to run the test suite or add tests to it, you will need to have
Expect and DejaGNU installed.  Any version of DejaGNU later than 1.3 should
work fine. We have mostly used Expect version 5.32 or later; older versions
may have bugs that may lead to unexpected test failures.

   <p>The next step is to configure and build VMIPS from source. This is important,
because currently, you can only run tests on a freshly built copy of VMIPS; no
provision exists for testing a previously installed copy of VMIPS.  Simply run
`<samp><span class="samp">./configure</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>' from the top level source directory to
build VMIPS. See the &ldquo;Installation&rdquo; section of the manual for more details.

   <p>To run the test suite, run `<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>' from the top level source
directory.  This will invoke the DejaGNU <samp><span class="command">runtest</span></samp> command. 
It will take a minute or so, and then you will get a count of tests that
passed and failed.  If you want to see a more comprehensive listing from
<samp><span class="command">runtest</span></samp>, pass it the appropriate options through the Makefile,
by typing, for example: `<samp><span class="samp">make RUNTESTFLAGS=--verbose check</span></samp>'.

   <p>You can also run the test suite by changing into the <samp><span class="file">test_code</span></samp>
directory in the source tree and running `<samp><span class="samp">runtest --tool vmips</span></samp>'.

   <p>As a general rule, no tests should fail in a released version of VMIPS;
however, CVS builds may have test failures from time to time.

<h4 class="subsection">12.0.2 Test suite frameworks</h4>

<p>VMIPS has two comprehensive testing frameworks: the <samp><span class="file">regcheck</span></samp>
framework, whose tests live in the <samp><span class="file">vmips.regcheck</span></samp> directory, and the
<samp><span class="file">outcheck</span></samp> framework, whose tests live in the <samp><span class="file">vmips.outcheck</span></samp>
directory. The former looks at the final values of registers after a test
case is run, and the latter looks at the output that VMIPS prints out when
a test case is run.

   <p>Each of these main testing frameworks has its own <samp><span class="file">.exp</span></samp> file that runs it. 
You can easily run the subset of the test suite controlled by a given
<samp><span class="file">.exp</span></samp> file, by passing its name on the <samp><span class="command">runtest</span></samp> command line. 
For example, if you want to run all the <samp><span class="file">regcheck</span></samp> tests, you would type:
`<samp><span class="samp">runtest --tool vmips regcheck.exp</span></samp>'.

   <p>There are a few test cases that do not use either of these frameworks,
because they have special requirements of some kind or are otherwise
unique in some inconvenient way. These test cases have their own Expect
drivers (<samp><span class="file">.exp</span></samp> files) and live in the <samp><span class="file">vmips.misc-tests</span></samp>
directory.

   <p>In addition, each test case is defined by a <samp><span class="file">.par</span></samp> file that contains the
parameters of the test.  If you only want to run a single test from among the
<samp><span class="file">regcheck</span></samp> tests, specify its <samp><span class="file">.par</span></samp> file after an equal sign. For
example, you might type: `<samp><span class="samp">runtest --tool vmips regcheck.exp=mumble.par</span></samp>'
to run only the <samp><span class="file">mumble.par</span></samp> <samp><span class="file">regcheck</span></samp> test.

<h4 class="subsection">12.0.3 How to add a test to the test suite</h4>

<p>To write a new test case, first decide whether it is easier to have your test
case print out something or to look at the <samp><span class="option">haltdumpcpu</span></samp> option's output
to verify it. This will tell you whether it should be an <samp><span class="file">outcheck</span></samp> test
(if it prints out something) or a <samp><span class="file">regcheck</span></samp> case (if you look at the
register values).  Then write up a <samp><span class="file">.par</span></samp> file for the test case &mdash;
the best way to learn how to do this, for the time being, is to examine the
examples in the <samp><span class="file">test_code</span></samp> directory. Then move the <samp><span class="file">.par</span></samp> file
and the test code (assembly or C) to the appropriate subdirectory for the
framework you chose, <samp><span class="file">vmips.regcheck</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">vmips.outcheck</span></samp>. Now
you can try to make sure that it passes (or fails, as the case may be),
by running `<samp><span class="samp">runtest --tool vmips</span></samp>' on it.

   <p>Also, note that you shouldn't add another test to <samp><span class="file">vmips.misc-tests</span></samp>
unless you can't find a way to fit it into any of the existing testing
frameworks. Adding a test to <samp><span class="file">vmips.misc-tests</span></samp> is tricky &ndash; you may be
able to make progress by looking at the other <samp><span class="file">.exp</span></samp> files in that
directory.

<h4 class="subsection">12.0.4 Common problems</h4>

<p>You can get screenfuls of `<samp><span class="samp">endian_option was not set</span></samp>' errors if you run
<samp><span class="command">runtest</span></samp> without first making a DejaGNU <samp><span class="file">site.exp</span></samp> configuration
file first.  To make a <samp><span class="file">site.exp</span></samp> file, just run `<samp><span class="samp">make site.exp</span></samp>'
in the <samp><span class="file">test_code</span></samp> directory.

<h4 class="subsection">12.0.5 Additional test cases needed</h4>

<p>Test cases should probably be added for the following categories of VMIPS
behaviors. (This list is from 2002; it is probably a good start, but it
may be out of date in the sense that it is unlikely to be exhaustive.)

     <ul>
<li>Vmipstool. 
<li>The debugger interface. 
<li>Exceptions: exception prioritizing, non-boot-time exception vectors,
all the TLB exceptions, Unimplemented Coprocessor exceptions, Reserved
Instruction exceptions, and exceptions due to PC address translation. 
<li>Check that the TLB does the right thing when you have a dirty entry
vs. a non-dirty one. 
<li>dumpcpu, dumpcp0, haltdumpcp0, bootmsg options. 
<li>tilde_expand() where it's not your own home directory. 
<li>Address translations in KSEG0 or KSEG2 or KUSEG or User mode. 
</ul>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Installation</h2>

<p>VMIPS uses the GNU Autoconf/Automake system for configuration management. 
This provides the familiar <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> shell script interface for
setting configuration variables before compiling VMIPS. This means that the
traditional `<samp><span class="samp">./configure; make; make install</span></samp>' sequence should work. 
For more information about the special options that VMIPS <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
accepts, read on, or give the <samp><span class="option">--help</span></samp> option to <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
for an abridged version.

<h3 class="section">A.1 Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The VMIPS build process assumes that you have a C++ compiler installed
on the host machine which can deal correctly with template functions. 
In particular, using GCC 2.91.66, also known as EGCS 1.1.2 (the system
compiler on Red Hat Linux 6.x systems)&mdash;or, we suspect, any older
compiler&mdash;is not possible, because the compiler will crash, giving an
&ldquo;internal compiler error&rdquo; message when trying to compile various VMIPS
subsystems.  For that reason, <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> checks for the bug in
question and will print an error message (&ldquo;your C++ compiler's template
function handling is buggy&rdquo;) if you attempt to use a deficient compiler.

   <p><a name="index-sample-code_002c-building-62"></a>If you want to build any of the sample code which is included with the
VMIPS source distribution, you must have a full set of GNU MIPS cross
compilation tools installed when you configure VMIPS.  You will need to
tell <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> the configuration prefix you used to install
the MIPS tools, by specifying it as the value to the <samp><span class="option">--with-mips</span></samp>
argument. For example, if your MIPS cross compiler is
<samp><span class="file">/opt/mipsTools/bin/mips-dec-ultrix4.3-gcc</span></samp>, then you should specify
<samp><span class="option">--with-mips=/opt/mipsTools</span></samp> on the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command
line. Additionally, you will also need to tell <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> the
target you used to configure the MIPS cross tools, by specifying it as the
value to the <samp><span class="option">--target</span></samp> argument (see below).  For a concise summary
of how to build the necessary MIPS cross tools, read &ldquo;Building MIPS Cross
Tools&rdquo;, below.

   <p><a name="index-test-suite_002c-running-63"></a>If you want to run the test suite, you must additionally have Expect and
DejaGNU installed (any version published since 2000 should be fine). Once
VMIPS is compiled, you can type `<samp><span class="samp">make check</span></samp>' to run the test suite.

<h3 class="section">A.2 Building from CVS</h3>

<p><a name="index-configure_002c-missing-64"></a><a name="index-configure_002c-creating-65"></a>If you retrieved your sources from the CVS repository, you will need
Automake version 1.4 or later, Autoconf version 2.13 or later, and libtool
1.2f or later. Newer versions of Autoconf (2.52f, 2.53) have been tested,
and should also work.  You will need perl 5 to build the documentation. 
Your distribution will be missing many important files, including
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>. To generate these, run <samp><span class="command">utils/bootstrap</span></samp>. To
automatically run configure once it has been generated, you can run
`<samp><span class="samp">utils/bootstrap -c CONFIGURE-ARGS</span></samp>'.

<h3 class="section">A.3 Options that configure supports</h3>

<p><a name="index-configure-66"></a><a name="index-configure_002c-options-supported-by-67"></a>Some of the interesting options that `<samp><span class="samp">configure</span></samp>' supports are as
follows:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--target=T</span></samp><dd>Specify the target used to configure your MIPS cross tools. `<samp><span class="samp">T</span></samp>' must
match the value of the <samp><span class="option">--target</span></samp> option provided to GNU Binutils
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-mips=MDIR</span></samp><dd>Specify installation prefix of MIPS cross tools (default MDIR = /opt/mips). 
If you do not have MIPS cross tools, the VMIPS test suite will not be
available and sample code will not be built. If you want <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
to ignore your MIPS cross tools, you can indicate this by specifying
`<samp><span class="samp">--without-mips</span></samp>'.

     <p>This flag is used to set the default value of the vmipsrc
<samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp> option. You can always edit the <samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp>
option setting in <samp><span class="file">/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp> after installation if you want to
change its value.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-mips-bin=DIR</span></samp><dd>Specify path to MIPS cross tools' executables (default MDIR/bin). This option
may be useful as an override if &ndash;with-mips isn't working for you, but beware
&mdash; it is rarely tested by the developers.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-mips-endianness=VAL</span></samp><dd>Specify the default endianness of the VMIPS simulated machine, which must match
the MIPS cross tools target's endianness.  VAL may be specified as <code>big</code>
or <code>little</code>.  If you have installed MIPS cross tools, it is best to let
configure guess this (which it will do by running `<samp><span class="samp">mips-objdump -i</span></samp>'),
unless you have reason to believe it is guessing wrong, because if you get
it wrong, vmipstool may compile ROMs that do not run correctly under vmips. 
If you are configuring without MIPS cross tools installed, this will default
to little-endian.

     <p>This flag is used to set the default value of the vmipsrc <samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp>
option. You can always edit the <samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp> option setting in
<samp><span class="file">/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp> after installation if you want to change this value.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--disable-debug</span></samp><dd>When you use this flag, <code>configure</code> will
          <ul>
<li>Turn on various compiler optimizations (compile with -O2)
<li>Strip debugging symbols from executables (link with -s), but only
if <samp><span class="option">--enable-profiling</span></samp> is not also turned on
<li>Initialize VMIPS registers to zero
<li>Disable runtime assertion checks
</ul>

     <p>When you do not use this flag, <code>configure</code> will
          <ul>
<li>Turn on debug info in the compiler (compile with -g)
<li>Initialize VMIPS registers to random values
<li>Compile in runtime assertion checks
</ul>

     <br><dt><samp><span class="option">--enable-profiling</span></samp><dd>Include (default=do not include) profiling instrumentation in the VMIPS
binary. This is only interesting if you are maintaining VMIPS and trying
to figure out why it is running more slowly than it should be. This
option doesn't seem to work very well on Mac OS X. Setting
this option inhibits stripping the executables.

   </dl>

<h3 class="section">A.4 Post-Installation Setup</h3>

<p>If you are an end-user with a binary package for VMIPS and a MIPS cross
compiler, you will probably want to make Vmipstool use the cross compiler
when you run commands such as <samp><span class="command">vmipstool --compile</span></samp>.

   <p>You should edit your <samp><span class="file">/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/.vmipsrc</span></samp> file and change
the <samp><span class="option">bigendian</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp> options to correspond
to the installed MIPS cross tools. (See the `Customizing' chapter for more
information on the syntax of these options.) Then, test it by trying to compile
a C file by running <samp><span class="command">vmipstool --compile -c foo.c</span></samp>. You should get
an object file (<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>) of the right endianness and object format;
you can check this using the <samp><span class="command">file</span></samp> command on most Unix systems.

<h3 class="section">A.5 Packaging VMIPS</h3>

<p>If you are a system integrator or distributor who is building a package
for VMIPS intended for distribution, you may be able to start by looking at
the RPM vmips.spec file or the Debian dpkg packaging files included in the
source distribution.

   <p>Your VMIPS package need not require a set of MIPS cross tools either at the
build or install stage.  Starting with VMIPS 1.2, it is perfectly possible
to build VMIPS without a cross-compiler, cross-assembler, or cross-linker. 
Vmipstool will not be very useful without cross-tools, but it will build;
however, an end-user can install cross-tools and edit the system-wide
<samp><span class="file">vmipsrc</span></samp> file to make the <samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp> option value contain
their location.

   <p>The VMIPS binary package should probably include the following files:
     <ul>
<li>the two executables <samp><span class="command">vmips</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">vmipstool</span></samp>
<li>the two man pages <samp><span class="file">vmips.1</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">vmipstool.1</span></samp>
<li>the VMIPS Programmer's Manual in some format (for example, the Info file
<samp><span class="file">vmips.info</span></samp>)
<li>the default GNU linker script used by vmipstool, <samp><span class="file">ld.script</span></samp>
<li>the system-wide configuration file <samp><span class="file">/etc/vmipsrc</span></samp>
<li>the assembler convenience header file <samp><span class="file">asm_regnames.h</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>Help keep VMIPS free! As VMIPS is released under the GNU General Public
License, please make an effort to distribute sources (or at least, post a
link to the sources) if you distribute binaries or binary packages. Thanks!

<h3 class="section">A.6 Building MIPS Cross Tools</h3>

<p>First decide on an installation prefix. The following examples will
use the prefix `<samp><span class="samp">/opt/mips</span></samp>', as above, which is the default place that
the VMIPS <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> script looks for them; you can however use any
prefix you wish.

   <p><a name="index-GNU-Binutils_002c-obtaining-68"></a>Download a copy of Binutils, from any GNU mirror, or from the URL:
<pre class="display">     <a href="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/releases">ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/binutils/releases</a>
</pre>
   <p>We recommend getting version 2.11.2 or 2.13.2.1.

   <p>Build binutils by running the following commands. We recommend
<code>--disable-nls</code> because some recent versions do not build correctly with
NLS (linking against <samp><span class="file">libopcodes.a</span></samp> results in unresolved symbols.)

<pre class="example">     ./configure --target=mipsel-ecoff --prefix=/opt/mips \
      --disable-nls --enable-shared
     make
     make install install-info
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-gcc-69"></a><a name="index-GNU-Compiler-Collection_002c-obtaining-70"></a>Download a copy of the GNU Compiler Collection (<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>) from
any GNU mirror, or from the URL:
<pre class="display">     <a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases">ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases</a>
</pre>
   <p>You should be able to use any version from 3.0 through 3.4. We've mostly
tested with 3.0.4. Our examples (below) will assume 3.0.4.

   <p><a name="index-GNU-Compiler-Collection_002c-installing-71"></a>You can read the documentation for building the compiler by pointing
your World-Wide Web browser at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install">http://gcc.gnu.org/install</a>. 
When you encounter difficulties, you should consider consulting the
documentation for building the compiler, because it is more complete
than the following summary.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Unpack the sources. Let's say you unpack them in <samp><span class="file">/usr/build</span></samp>,
creating the directory <samp><span class="file">/usr/build/gcc-3.0.4</span></samp>.

     <li>Create the build directory <samp><span class="file">/usr/build/gcc-mips-build</span></samp>.

     <p><a name="index-GNU-Compiler-Collection_002c-configuring-72"></a><li>First, add the directory <samp><span class="file">/opt/mips/bin</span></samp> (where you just installed
Binutils) to your path, so that the compiler configuration process can
find your MIPS-targetted assembler and linker.

     <li>Configure the compiler. Change to the directory
<samp><span class="file">/usr/build/gcc-mips-build</span></samp> and issue the following command. (The
back-slash characters represent the usual Unix shell convention of continuing
a command on the following line, and are inserted for typesetting purposes.)

     <pre class="example">          ../gcc-3.0.4/configure --target=mipsel-ecoff \
           --prefix=/opt/mips --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld \
           --disable-threads --disable-shared
     </pre>
     <li>If the configuration step fails, make sure you have a working native
compiler, and/or try a different version of gcc. Otherwise, proceed to compile
the compiler:

     <pre class="example">          make -k MAKE='make -k TARGET_LIBGCC2_CFLAGS=-Dinhibit_libc' cross
          make -k LANGUAGES=c install
     </pre>
     <p>The reason `<samp><span class="samp">make -k</span></samp>' is required is because some parts of the gcc
toolkit may fail to build, but the compiler itself may be OK.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-Dinhibit_libc</span></samp> option is required when you are building
the compiler in the absence of a MIPS C library, as is often the case
with VMIPS users.

     <p>Do not be alarmed by errors in building or installing the compiler;
the cross compiler install interface is less than polished.

     <li>You should be able to use the newly-installed  compiler to compile
(but not link) a program that does not use any C library functions. 
If this works, you should be able to use the cross tools you have just
built for VMIPS.

     <li>If you want to use the GNU debugger (GDB) to debug MIPS programs running
on VMIPS, you can build that now.

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Download a copy of the GNU debugger from any GNU mirror, or from
the URL:
          <pre class="display">               <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdb/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdb/</a>
          </pre>
          <p>We recommend version 5.2.1. Download the file <samp><span class="file">gdb-5.2.1.tar.gz</span></samp>.

          <li>Unpack the file and change to the directory <samp><span class="file">gdb-5.2.1</span></samp>. 
<li>Type the following commands to configure and build GDB:
          <pre class="example">               ./configure --prefix=/opt/mips --target=mipsel-ecoff
               make
               make install install-info
          </pre>
          <li>You can now use the newly installed <samp><span class="file">mipsel-ecoff-gdb</span></samp> to debug
programs with VMIPS, as described in the &ldquo;Debugging&rdquo; section of the manual.
          </ol>

     <li>If you want to build a MIPS C library, you can also do that now, but
it is not strictly required for many useful VMIPS tasks.

     <p>Here is how to build the uClibc C library for use with VMIPS:

     <p>As noted in the uClibc INSTALL file, you will need Linux kernel
sources.  Just pick a recent version of Linux 2.4; you can download it
from <a href="http://www.kernel.org">http://www.kernel.org</a> or one of its mirrors, if you don't have
it handy.  You will need to configure (but not build) the Linux kernel for
MIPS. Here's how:

          <ul>
<li>Edit <samp><span class="file">linux/Makefile</span></samp>, setting <var>ARCH</var> to `<samp><span class="samp">mips</span></samp>' and setting
<var>CROSS_COMPILE</var> to a value that corresponds to the path where your MIPS
cross compiler is installed, for example: `<samp><span class="samp">/opt/mips-elf/bin/mips-elf-</span></samp>'
(this is just like <samp><span class="option">mipstoolprefix</span></samp> in your <samp><span class="file">vmipsrc</span></samp> file).

          <li>Copy <samp><span class="file">arch/mips/defconfig</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">.config</span></samp>.

          <li>Run `<samp><span class="samp">make oldconfig</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">make dep</span></samp>'. 
</ul>

     <p>Next, download uClibc from <a href="http://www.uclibc.org">http://www.uclibc.org</a>, and unpack it
next to the Linux kernel sources. The last version we tested was 0.9.26. 
Read the <samp><span class="file">INSTALL</span></samp> file in that distribution.

     <p>When you configure uClibc with `<samp><span class="samp">make config</span></samp>', be sure to pick `<samp><span class="samp">mips</span></samp>'
as your Target Architecture, and `<samp><span class="samp">Generic (MIPS I)</span></samp>' as your Target
Processor. Be sure to pick the correct endianness (that is, the one which
corresponds to the default endianness of your cross tools.) You should be sure
to answer yes to 'Target CPU has a memory management unit (MMU)' and no to
'Enable floating point number support', because current versions of VMIPS
do not include floating-point support.  If you are intending to use uClibc
to build ROMs, you will probably want to turn off position-independent code
and shared library support.  Turn on only those other features of uClibc
as you expect you will need.  For the <var>DEVEL_PREFIX</var>, specify a new
empty directory.

     <p>Then run `<samp><span class="samp">make CROSS=/opt/mips-elf/bin/mips-elf-</span></samp>' to build uClibc (for
<var>CROSS</var>, you should use the same value as you used for <var>CROSS_COMPILE</var>
in the Linux Makefile, above) and run `<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>' to install it.

     <p>In the directory you specified for <var>DEVEL_PREFIX</var> when configuring
uClibc, above, you will now have <samp><span class="file">usr/include</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">usr/lib</span></samp>
subdirectories. You will now want to copy these to where your cross compiler
can detect and use them. For GCC, the directories are

          <ul>
<li><var>prefix</var>/<var>target-triplet</var>/lib  (for libraries)
<li><var>prefix</var>/<var>target-triplet</var>/sys-include  (for includes)
</ul>

     <p>For example, if you configured GCC for target `<samp><span class="samp">mips-unknown-elf</span></samp>'
with prefix `<samp><span class="samp">/usr/local/mips</span></samp>', you would copy the <samp><span class="file">usr/include</span></samp>
directory to <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/mips/mips-unknown-elf/sys-include</span></samp>, and copy
the <samp><span class="file">usr/lib</span></samp> directory to <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/mips/mips-unknown-elf/lib</span></samp>.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Future Directions</h2>

<p>The following is a list of things we would like to add to VMIPS. Please get in
touch with us if you think you would be willing to help.

     <ul>
<li>Cache and DMA support in the memory subsystem.

     <li>A just-in-time translator from MIPS machine code to the host's
machine code. X86 and PowerPC would probably be the first hosts to target.

     <li>Add meaningful bindings to an extension language such as Tcl/Tk. 
In particular, it should be possible to read or write option values,
modify the configuration of the machine (by attaching or removing devices,
for example), and type commands interactively to VMIPS.  There should
be some provision for refreshing cached option values if the extension
language changes them.

     <li>Modularize the CPU, memory mapper, and devices using a shared-library
pluggable module interface.

     <li>Make it so that the debugger can be attached and detached at any
time, without the user having had to think of it beforehand and supply
the debug option. Delay the debugging interface initialization until a
connection is received?

     <li>Graphical user interface with register and memory display and editing,
support for loading, running, and stepping programs, and setting breakpoints.

     <li>Support for loading binary files other than ROMs (and, by
implication, for starting off with something other than a Reset.) Lots
of people are going to expect to be able to do this, so it seems like
a good thing to do. We can probably leverage BFD for most of this.

     <li>Support for non-English languages using NLS.

     <li>MIPS R3010 FPU emulation.  A good way to get started
on building an FPU would be to use SoftFloat:

     <p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jhauser/arithmetic/softfloat.html">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jhauser/arithmetic/softfloat.html</a>.

     <li>ROM monitor network booting support.

     <li>Full MIPS32 support.

     <li>Checkpoint and restart of simulations.

     <li>Develop a patch for gas to support software register names.  gas supports
$sp and $gp but not, say, $t0.

     <li>Consolidate some of the .h files that just contain huge lists of useful
constants.

   </ul>

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D Release History</h2>

<p>vmips-1.3.2 was released on 27 March 2007. 
User-visible changes in version 1.3.2 (since version 1.3.1):

     <ul>
<li>A bug was fixed in the code which responded to address-translation
exceptions by loading the CP0 Context register. It was loading the
wrong virtual page number.

     <li>Problems compiling VMIPS with gcc 4.1.x have been fixed.

   </ul>

   <p>vmips-1.3.1 was released on 5 January 2005. 
User-visible changes in version 1.3.1 (since version 1.3):

     <ul>
<li>VMIPS now compiles and passes most of its regression tests
under Microsoft Windows using Cygwin. There is one known failure
(misc-tests/echo), but the failure stems from the testsuite, not VMIPS;
I suspect that my old version of Expect is at fault.

     <li>The build status report script, <samp><span class="file">buildstat.sh</span></samp>, has been
removed from the distribution.  (Since it was broken in version 1.3 and
no one complained, we're assuming that no one will miss it much!)

     <li>Two bugs in the testsuite that could have led to spurious test
failures have been fixed. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.3 was released on 8 October 2004. 
User-visible changes in version 1.3 (since version 1.2.2):

     <ul>
<li>The VMIPS code base has been cleaned up substantially. The most
important visible effect of this is that VMIPS compiles much more quickly now.

     <li>A new, experimental executable-file loader has been integrated. Presently
it is only usable for loading ECOFF files into the kernel segments
(0x80000000-0xbfffffff). The ROM monitor has a new <samp><span class="command">call</span></samp> command you
can use to take advantage of this.

     <li>Vmipstool can now disassemble binary instructions from the command
line, e.g.  `<samp><span class="samp">vmipstool --disassemble-word &lt;pc&gt; &lt;instr&gt;</span></samp>'.

     <li>The <samp><span class="option">excmsg</span></samp> option used to report all exceptions, including
things like clock interrupts. This made using <samp><span class="option">excmsg</span></samp> in any
nontrivial kernel code almost impossible. Now you must also specify
'reportirq' to get reports of interrupt exceptions.

     <li>The <samp><span class="option">haltjrra</span></samp> option has been removed.

     <li>The DECstation 5000/200-compatible CSR device now supports delivery
of interrupts from devices attached to CSR interrupt lines, such as the DZ11
serial device.

     <li>The DZ11 serial device now supports interrupt-driven I/O properly. It
previously only worked correctly if polling was used.

     <li>The documentation has received the usual slight adjustments. In
addition, the test-suite documentation has been extensively revised and
integrated into the programmer's manual.

     <li>The options-processing code has been revised slightly to print a better
error message when an invalid option is specified. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.2.2 was released on 23 August 2004. 
User-visible changes in version 1.2.2 (since version 1.2.1):

     <ul>
<li>A bug in the Makefiles and configure scripts has been fixed, where
some files would not be installed if you didn't configure with cross
compilation tools (using <samp><span class="option">--with-mips</span></samp>).

     <li>Vladimir Machulsky found and fixed a bug in the debugger interface,
where the register file would be sent to gdb incorrectly. Thanks!

     <li>VMIPS will no longer abort and dump core when bad command-line
rguments
are passed to it.  Instead, it will print an error message and exit with
a non-zero exit code.

     <li>A bug in the command-line option processor was fixed, where using a
completely empty <samp><span class="file">~/.vmipsrc</span></samp> or the `<samp><span class="samp">-F /dev/null</span></samp>' option could cause
the options parser to parse garbage, usually resulting in harmless,
but annoying error messages. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.2.1 was released on 26 July 2004. 
User-visible changes in version 1.2.1 (since version 1.2):

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where delay slot execution could be triggered even when
emulating a malformed jr (jump-register) instruction.

     <li>Fixed a bug where, upon taking a TLB Miss exception, the ASID of the
page that could not be looked up would be overwritten (in the CP0 EntryHi
register) with garbage.

     <li>Fixed a bug in VMIPS configurations with multiple interrupt devices,
where Interrupt Pending bits of the CP0 Cause from previous interrupts could
be left asserted even if the device that asserted them had subsequently
deasserted them.

     <li>Fixed a bug where the memory dump file and ROM file would be opened
in text mode. They are now opened in binary mode. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.2 was released on 26 June 2004. 
User-visible changes in version 1.2 (since version 1.1.3):

     <ul>
<li>Many documentation updates have been made. Note that the documentation
has been relicensed under the MIT license, instead of the GNU FDL.

     <li>Many facets of VMIPS are now configurable at runtime, instead of at
compile time. For instance:

     <p>	It is now possible to build and install VMIPS without having previously
installed MIPS cross-compiler tools. In particular, VMIPS now incorporates
the portions of GNU libopcodes used to implement the MIPS disassembler,
so linking against an installed version of libopcodes from GNU binutils is
no longer necessary.

     <p>	It is now possible to switch the VMIPS CPU from big-endian to
little-endian mode or vice-versa using a command-line option.

     <p>	It is now possible to change the name of the configuration file
that VMIPS reads on startup using a command-line option. The "-o configfile"
option, which never worked, has been removed.

     <li>vmipstool now shares command-line processing code with vmips. It also
has a new &ndash;swap-words option that allows you to byteswap all the 4-byte
words in a file.

     <li>You can now specify numeric constants in command line options which
are multiples of 1024, 1024^2, or 1024^3 using the K, M, or G suffixes.

     <li>Several new emulated devices based on the DECstation 5000/200 have
been added.  In particular, it is no longer possible to disable the serial
device at compile time (or with <samp><span class="option">-o nousetty</span></samp>), but you can choose
whether to use the DECstation serial chip or the SPIM-compatible serial
console (or neither) using new command-line options. In addition, the ROM
program distributed with VMIPS supports a "boot environment" similar to
that provided by the DECstation PROM. The new DECstation-compatible devices
have not been comprehensively validated; they should be considered "beta"
quality at this point.

     <li>There is a new tracing framework you can use to generate runtime
execution traces of programs that run in VMIPS. See the documentation of the
"tracing" command-line option and the other options that begin with "trace"
for more details.

     <li>The VMIPS interface to GDB now supports the "remote Z-packet" interface
for setting breakpoints.

     <li>VMIPS now prints more informative diagnostic messages about the causes
of bus errors and interrupts.

     <li>You can now use ^C (your terminal's Interrupt key) to stop VMIPS and
break into the debugger, if the <samp><span class="option">-o debug</span></samp> command line option was
set, or ^\ (your terminal's Quit key) to halt VMIPS in an orderly manner at
any time.

     <li>The <samp><span class="option">--disable-debug</span></samp> option to <code>configure</code> now strips the
compiled VMIPS binaries, although it has been documented to do this for some
time now. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.1.3 was released on 24 October 2003. 
User-visible changes in version 1.1.3 (since version 1.1.2):

     <ul>
<li>A bug in comparing large immediate constants near UINT_MAX using
the sltiu instruction has been fixed.

     <li>A bug where the meaning of the `dirty' bit in TLB entries was
accidentally reversed has been fixed.

     <li>A bug in specifying which bits are treated as writable in the CP0
EntryLo register by the tlbr instruction has been fixed. Thanks to Mingyu
Chen for pointing out these last two bugs. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.1.2 was released on 20 August 2003. 
User-visible changes in version 1.1.2 (since version 1.1.1):

     <ul>
<li>An instruction that turns on interrupts in the system control coprocessor
  (coprocessor 0) will no longer immediately take an exception if an interrupt
  is pending; now it will happen at least one instruction later.

     <li>When building VMIPS in debug mode, the coprocessor 0 Cause register may no
  longer contain random, non-clearable interrupt-pending bits.

     <li>The coprocessor 0 Cause register's interrupt-pending and coprocessor-error
  bits are now correctly updated when an exception is taken.

     <li>The VMIPS physical-memory manager will now allow you to place two devices
  directly adjacent to one another in memory; it used to complain that they
  overlapped, when they actually did not.

     <li>A typo was fixed in the testsuite documentation. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.1.1 was released on 16 June 2003. 
User-visible changes in version 1.1.1 (since version 1.1):

     <ul>
<li>A bug involving shifts by 0 or 32 bits (e.g., using instructions like srlv)
  producing incorrect results has been fixed.

     <li>The absence of an FPU attached to coprocessor slot 1 can now be
  detected by user programs.

     <li>The system control coprocessor (coprocessor 0) now returns the correct ID
  number for the R3000A processor in the PRId register.

     <li>Emulation of store-byte and store-halfword operations for emulated devices
  that only support store-word should now work correctly on byte-swapped
  configurations.

     <li>A bug in vmipstool which caused it to fail to find alternate linker scripts
  (supplied with the &ndash;ld-script option) has been fixed.

     <li>A gcc warning caused by a (harmless) comment in asm_regnames.h has
  been quashed.

     <li>A bug where little-endian vmips configurations would dump core when
  the disassembler was used (e.g., when the instdump option was turned on)
  has been fixed.

     <li>`configure' no longer ignores its &ndash;with-mips-include option. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.1 was released on 14 March 2003. 
User-visible changes in version 1.1 (since version 1.0.4):

     <ul>
<li>If you are using g++ to compile VMIPS, you must use g++ version 2.95
  or later. Also, you must specify the &ndash;target option to `configure',
  with an argument that matches the &ndash;target option to binutils
  `configure'. See `INSTALL'.

     <li>VMIPS now supports GNU standard &ndash;help and &ndash;version options.

     <li>The manual now includes improved documentation for using gdb and
  Insight to control VMIPS, a section on the differences between SPIM's
  console and the SPIM-compatible console device, a section on proper
  error reporting from VMIPS extensions, and many other minor
  revisions.

     <li>Using gdb to control VMIPS is now much more robust in the face of
  errors and exceptions.

     <li>VMIPS 1.1 makes it possible to use the 2nd display/keyboard channel
  of the SPIM-compatible console device, using the `ttydev2' option.

     <li>VMIPS now includes a halt device, which can be used to halt the
  simulator without using a special instruction.

     <li>VMIPS 1.1 is much faster than VMIPS 1.0.4. This is due in large part
  to the efforts of Paul Twohey, who reimplemented the clock and
  SPIM-compatible console devices, and cleaned up the code a bit.

     <li>The VMIPS distribution now includes a regression test suite, based on
  DejaGNU (replaces the old test_code directory). In order to support
  this, the formats of lots of random messages that VMIPS prints out
  have changed.

     <li>We now support 64-bit hosts (e.g., Alpha). 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.0.4 was released on 28 April 2002. 
User-visible changes in version 1.0.4 (since version 1.0.3):

     <ul>
<li>Fixed bug where the first instruction of an interrupt handler would be
  executed twice in a row. Thanks to Paul Twohey.

     <li>Workaround some problems in the way casts are used in VMIPS by specifying
  -fno-strict-aliasing to gcc in configure; this should help avoid
  miscompilations for now, until the code can be rewritten for cast-safety.

     <li>Fix bug where vmips would dereference a NULL pointer when trying to use a
  SPIMConsole device with a non-attached serial host. Thanks to Paul Twohey.

     <li>Reorder some tests in the SPIMConsole code for a slight speedup when
  interrupts are turned off.

     <li>Fix bug where virtual page numbers were being incorrectly interpreted
  by the system control coprocessor, resulting in excess TLB misses being
  generated. Thanks to Sanjeev Datla. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.0.3 was released on 12 January 2002. 
User-visible changes in version 1.0.3 (since version 1.0.2):

     <ul>
<li>Fixed bug in debugger interface; TLB translations caused by the debugger
  trying to access user space could fail if the virtual page number was
  not 0.

     <li>Fixed bugs in the following instructions: lb, lh, lwr, lwl, swr,
  swl, nor.

     <li>Clarified some especially confusing comments in the source code,
  in one of the test cases, and in the testsuite README.

     <li>The sample setup code now halts on all exceptions, including user TLB
  miss exceptions.

     <li>Fixed some warnings compiling xmboot using recent versions of gcc. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.0.2 was released on 17 December 2001. 
User-visible changes in version 1.0.2 (since version 1.0.1):

     <ul>
<li>Add warning message to man page directing the interested reader to the
  Info manual.

     <li>New default handling of `-o ttydev' option; manual updated.

     <li>/etc/vmipsrc contains only comments by default. 
  These two fixes work around a bug in Darwin select(2)'s tty handling.

     <li>Only print host processor endianness if `-o bootmsg' is set. 
  Fixes bug where `-o bootmsg' should (but doesn't) turn this message off.

     <li>Remove test_code/testdev.S from the branch. 
  This is a test for a feature (TestDev) which wasn't distributed with 1.0.x.

     <li>Comment out extra tokens after #endif in test_code/{sort.c,tester.c}. 
  Fixes bug where gcc 3.0 gives warnings compiling these files. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.0.1 was released on 27 November 2001. 
User-visible changes in version 1.0.1 (since version 1.0):

     <ul>
<li>Fixed format-string bug in vmipstool.

     <li>Fixed "extra tokens after #endif" warning in sample_code/asm_regnames.h. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-1.0 was released on 28 October 2001. 
User-visible changes in version 1.0 (since version 0.9):

     <ul>
<li>A standard clock device has been added.

     <li>The "vmipstool" front end to compilation tools was added, and most of
  the random scripts lying around have been consolidated into it.

     <li>The memory-mapped test device known as "TestDev" has been removed.

     <li>Debian and Red Hat packaging files have been added.

     <li>The installation procedure has been greatly improved.

     <li>The VMIPS manual has been completed.

     <li>Many, many bugs fixed as a result of a concerted attempt at testing
  everything.  Doubtless, some bugs still remain.

     <li>Some portability fixes.

     <li>Dumping of the stack (when registers are dumped) now works.

     <li>Many strange messages the debugger backend used to print out have been
  quelled. Also, killing the debugger connection should no longer cause
  a crash.

     <li>vmips now supports &ndash;help, &ndash;version and &ndash;print-config command-line
  options.

     <li>The SPIM-compatible console device now works better when the host
  machine is byte-swapped with respect to the MIPS target. 
</ul>

   <p>vmips-0.9 was released on 9 May 2001. 
User-visible changes in version 0.9 (since version 20001014):

     <ul>
<li>vmips.debug is no longer built.

     <li>Read-only memory is now really read-only.  This allowed us to add
  debugger support for breakpoints in ROM.

     <li>Debugger support for exception handling &ndash; CPU exceptions are now
  delivered to your GDB, if it is attached, giving you a chance to poke
  around before the target is made aware of the condition.

     <li>Many tasty configury updates, making it easier to build.

     <li>Miscellaneous bugs fixed in many places.

     <li>Branch on coprocessor 0 instructions now have defined behavior.

     <li>Many places which erroneously had text after #endif in the source have
  been corrected to use comments instead, allowing you to compile vmips
  with newer C++ compilers.

     <li>Some old test code that used to run at the beginning of every vmips
  job has been removed, so you will no longer see the familiar messages
  it printed out. 
</ul>

   <p>User-visible changes since version 20000517:

     <ul>
<li>Emulating a little-endian MIPS on a big-endian host passes preliminary
  tests.  Build process queries MIPS tools for their endianness
  automatically.  Builds tested on Solaris SPARC, i386 Linux, FreeBSD
  and HP-UX.  Distribution building (gmake distcheck) almost works. 
</ul>

   <p>User-visible changes since version 19991114:

     <ul>
<li>Polling input and output via the SPIM-compatible console device now work. 
</ul>

   <p>User-visible changes since version 19990829:

     <ul>
<li>Build processes seeks out MIPS tools; Installation documentation now
  briefly documents how to build cross tools. 
</ul>

   <p>User-visible changes since version 19990823:

     <ul>
<li>Spim console documentation completed; first attempt at spim console code. 
</ul>

   <p>User-visible changes since version 19990801:

     <ul>
<li>Documentation Makefile.in has been built.

     <li>Some documentation has been updated.

     <li>VMIPS is being adapted to use GNU Autoconf and Automake. 
</ul>

<!-- used to add entries to it, and a two letter code used in @printindex -->
<!-- and @syncodeindex.  @printindex is used at the end of the manual to -->
<!-- print the index.  @syncodeindex is used at the beginning of the manual -->
<!-- to merge indices. -->
<!-- A "concept index" listing concepts that are discussed.  `@cindex CONCEPT' -->
<!-- makes an entry in the concept index for CONCEPT.  `cp' is the @printindex -->
<!-- code. -->
<!-- A "function index" listing functions (such as entry points of libraries). -->
<!-- `@findex FUNCTION' makes an entry in the function index for FUNCTION. -->
<!-- `fn' is the @printindex code. -->
<!-- A "variables index" listing variables (such as global variables of -->
<!-- libraries).  `@vindex VARIABLE' makes an entry in the variable index -->
<!-- for VARIABLE.  `vr' is the @printindex code. -->
<!-- A "keystroke index" listing keyboard commands.  `@kindex KEYSTROKE' makes -->
<!-- an entry in the key index for KEYSTROKE.  `ky' is the @printindex code. -->
<!-- A "program index" listing names of programs.  `@pindex PROGRAM' makes an -->
<!-- entry in the program index for PROGRAM.  `pg' is the @printindex code. -->
<!-- A "data type index" listing data types (such as structures defined -->
<!-- `@tindex DATA TYPE' makes an entry in the data type index for DATA TYPE. -->
<!-- `tp' is the @printindex code. -->
